  abstract = {Competitive rowing highly values boat position and velocity data for real-time feedback during training, racing and post-training analysis. The ubiquity of smartphones with embedded position (GPS) and motion (accelerometer) sensors motivates their possible use in these tasks. In this paper, we investigate the use of two real-time digital filters to achieve highly accurate yet reasonably priced measurements of boat speed and distance traveled. Both filters combine acceleration and location data to estimate boat distance and speed; the first using a complementary frequency response-based filter technique, the second with a Kalman filter formalism that includes adaptive, real-time estimates of effective accelerometer bias. The estimates of distance and speed from both filters were validated and compared with accurate reference data from a differential GPS system with better than 1 cm precision and a 5 Hz update rate, in experiments using two subjects (an experienced club-level rower and an elite rower) in two different boats on a 300 m course. Compared with single channel (smartphone GPS only) measures of distance and speed, the complementary filter improved the accuracy and precision of boat speed, boat distance traveled, and distance per stroke by 44\%, 42\%, and 73\%, respectively, while the Kalman filter improved the accuracy and precision of boat speed, boat distance traveled, and distance per stroke by 48\%, 22\%, and 82\%, respectively. Both filters demonstrate promise as general purpose methods to substantially improve estimates of important rowing performance metrics.},

  abstract = {We previously presented a narrow-track tilting tricycle with a variable stability mechanism integrated between the swing arms that support a pair of rear wheels, in the so-called ``delta'' configuration. We now examine adopting that variable stability mechanism to work on a tricycle with a split-parallelogram linkage between a pair of front wheels, in the so-called ``tadpole'' configuration. It was fairly straightforward to allow for varying the stability by implementing each side of the split parallelogram with two A-arms and a kingpin, and then controlling the motion of the two halves with a bell crank and two tie rods, just as we did with the swing arms of the previous vehicle. We have also separated the two tasks of positioning the tie rod ends on the bell crank and enforcing symmetry of the tie rods. The former does not require much force and can be easily implemented with the same cables the rider uses to control the mechanism, but the latter does require large forces and is better implemented with a local linkage. Implementing a decent Ackermann steering geometry, allowing for both large tilt and steer angles, and decoupling tilting from steering, however, proved to be quite a challenge, at least while we attempted to implement it with bar linkages. Fortunately, we discovered a 2006 paper by Prof Drstven\v{s}ek et al. describing a Bowden cable and cam system that looked promising. The resulting vehicle handles nicely. When in ``full bicycle'' mode, it handles quite similar to the original bicycle that was converted into the tricycle. When in ``rigid tricycle'' mode, it keeps the rider upright when stationary or when riding at a walking pace. In between these two extremes, it handles even better than the original bicycle in a slalom course and when slowly following a straight line.},

Despite this, the majority of engineering software designed to analyze multibody systems are numeric in nature (or present a purely numeric user interface). To our knowledge, none of the existing software packages are 1) fully symbolic, 2) open source, and 3) implemented in a popular, general, purpose high level programming language. In response, we extended SymPy (an existing computer algebra system implemented in Python) with functionality for derivation of symbolic EOMs for constrained multibody systems with many degrees of freedom. We present the design and implementation of the software and cover the basic usage and workflow for solving and analyzing problems. The intended audience is the academic research community, graduate and advanced undergraduate students, and those in industry analyzing multibody systems. We demonstrate the software by deriving the EOMs of a N-link pendulum, show its capabilities for LATEX output, and how it integrates with other Python scientific libraries \textemdash{} allowing for numerical simulation, publication quality plotting, animation, and online notebooks designed for sharing results. This software fills a unique role in dynamics and is attractive to academics and industry because of its BSD open source license which permits open source or commercial use of the code.},

The present research goal is to practically realize and fabricate one of these theoretically optimal bicycle designs and evaluate whether it does in fact have better lateral handling qualities than a traditional bicycle. To this end, a theoretically optimal bike design was designed and fabricated based on the parameters of a track bicycle. The bicycle exhibits exceptional handling in simulation and the fabricated bicycle is rideable. Future work will subjectively and objectively evaluate the handling of the bicycle.},

  abstract = {Bicycles can potentially be designed to be more safe by utilizing a theoretical handling quality metric (HQM) derived from previous aircraft pilot modeling work [1]. We are working to experimentally validate this metric, but previous experimental results [2] were limited due to the lack of precise control over the instrumented electric bicycle's speed during slalom and line tracking maneuvers. The purpose of this work is to improve the instrumented electric bicycle such that it can maintain its speed within +/- 0.1 m/s of a desired target speed. Here we present the design and preliminary implementation of a PID speed controller for an electric bicycle.},

Previous models determined the sensitivity of stability to changes in parameters, but have often used idealized parameters occurring in the equations of motion that were not possible to realistically change independently. A mathematical model of a bicycle is developed and verified. The model is used together with a physical parameter generation algorithm to evaluate the dependence of four important actual design parameters on the self-stability of a bicycle.},

They also revealed that other motions such as lateral movement of the knees were used in low speed stabilization. In order to validate the hypothesis that there is little upper body motion during casual cycling, an in-depth motion capture analysis was performed on the bicycle and rider system. We used motion capture technology to record the motion of three similar young adult male riders riding two different city bicycles on a treadmill. Each rider rode each bicycle while performing stability trials at speeds ranging from 2 km/h to 30 km/h: stabilizing while pedaling normally, stabilizing without pedaling, line tracking while pedaling, and stabilizing with nohands. These tasks were chosen with the intent of examining differences in the kinematics at various speeds, the effects of pedaling on the system, upper body control motions and the differences in tracking and stabilization. Principal component analysis was used to transform the data into a manageable set organized by the variance associated with the principal components. In this paper, these principal components were used to characterize various distinct kinematic motions that occur during stabilization with and without pedaling. These motions were grouped on the basis of correlation and conclusions were drawn about which motions are candidates for stabilization related control actions.},

  abstract = {We present a method to find an optimal handling bicycle using purely analytical and numerical means. Given a linear parametrized bicycle vehicle model, a simple manual controller, and a model-based metric that correlates with subjective handling measures, we formulate the search for optimal geometric parameters that give the best handling bicycle. Optimal bicycle designs for a number of design speeds are discovered including bicycles with unintuitive geometry, such as large negative trail. The resulting maximum handling quality metrics for the optimal bicycle designs follow a logarithmic relationship with respect to design speed. These optimal handling bicycles can be ridden at speeds other than the design speed and, in general, handling difficulty decreases with increasing speed. Finally, we show that there is little evidence of correlation between bicycle open-loop stability and optimal handling.},

Here we expand that method to optimize over all of the geometric and inertial parameters in the linear Whipple-Carvallo bicycle model. To ensure physically realizable bicycle designs we include 7 equality constraints, 21 inequality constraints, and lower and upper bounds on each free optimization parameter. This improves over the prior work by expanding the search space with many more parameters and the guarantee of physical realizability. We present four bicycle designs discovered by the optimization procedure that have optimal later handling qualities. The bicycles are similar in design to familiar bicycle designs but are not generally self-stable and exhibit unusual characteristics such as large positive and negative trail, large size relative to the rider, and minimal steering inertia. The method is a useful tool for generating atypical bicycle designs that exhibit desired dynamical qualities and could be broadly applied to other vehicle designs.},

  abstract = {Physical design features of ground vehicles can affect their lateral handling qualities. Geometry, mass, and mass distribution of the vehicle's primary components as well as tire characteristics are primary contributors to poor and good handling due to their important influence on the vehicle's dynamics. In past work, we have presented a theoretical and computational framework for assessing the lateral task-independent handling qualities of simplified single track vehicle designs [1, 4]. In subsequent work, we showed that minimizing our handling quality metric (HQM) can produce theoretically optimal handling designs when only four geometric parameters are explored as the optimization variables [3]. The present work's goal is to expand this optimization problem to 24 geometry, mass, and inertial parameters as the optimization variables so that a broader search space of optimal bicycle designs is considered. This task is complicated by the fact that we desire to limit the search space to physically realizable designs. Doing so introduces 35 linear and nonlinear constraint equations on the optimization variables. We formulate a constrained optimization problem and use nonlinear programming to discover optimal, yet realizable, bicycle designs.},

  abstract = {Bicycle paths or even bicycle lanes have not emerged as key priorities in traditional pavement systems analysis. Most cities rely on route preferences (e.g.,\textbackslash\&nbsp;common school routes) or visual checks to prioritize pavement conditions on bicycle facilities. We used 31 bike path sections with a representative range of pavement surface conditions to collect acceleration data, GPS location data, bicycle steering angle, surface displacement data, and mean texture depth (MTD) data. We also recruited cyclists to complete a post-ride survey on ride quality. Using these data, we specified two ordered logit regression models to separately examine the relationships between bicycle ride quality and traditional pavement roughness measurement (or surface defect density on trajectories) while holding other parameters (e.g.,\textbackslash\&nbsp;bicycle accelerations and steering angle) constant. Our study shows that a surface defect index can replace the MTD test for bicycle facilities and can produce better performance in predicting ride quality, especially when pavement condition needs moderate repair to avoid becoming much worse. We also examine ride quality, specifically the vertical acceleration effect on ride experience, for different types of bicycles (e.g.,\textbackslash\&nbsp;a mountain bike with a suspension system versus a touring bike).},

  abstract = {Microscopic simulation is an established tool in traffic engineering and research, where aggregated traffic performance measures are inferred from the simulation of individual agents. Additionally, measures describing the safety and efficiency of road user interactions gain importance for recent developments such as automated vehicles and urban cycling. However, current simulation frameworks model interactions including cyclists only with limited realism. To address this issue, we propose to bring bicycle dynamics to traffic simulation. We demonstrate that a novel reformulation of the social force framework can create input signals for a controlled inverted pendulum bicycle model and thereby enable a fully two-dimensional open space simulation of cyclist interactions. The inverted pendulum model introduces the need to stabilize the bicycle as a constraint to the reactive behavior of simulated cyclists. Furthermore, it enables the simulation of countersteering and weaving for stabilization. Our cyclist social forces have anisotropic force fields with respect to relative interaction position and orientation to describe the varying interaction constellations in open space. With these models, we simulate five single- and multi-cyclist test cases and show that the generated trajectories notably differ from results obtained from a 2D bicycle model without lean angle simulation. Measurements of the maximum lateral path deviation and post-encroachment time show that these differences are relevant for typical applications. Our work demonstrates the potential of introducing physics-based realistic bicycle dynamics to the microscopic simulation of individual road user interactions and the fundamental capability of our reformulated cyclist social forces to do so. Going further, we plan to calibrate and validate our model based on naturalistic cycling data to support the initial results of this work.},

Experimental data were obtained from riding a bicycle on a narrow treadmill while perturbing balance with impulsive forces at the seat post. The experiments were conducted at 2\textendash 7 m/s covering both the stable and the unstable forward speed range. Bicycle and rider mechanics have been modeled using the Whipple bicycle model extended with the rider inertia. A rider control model applying steering torque at the handle bars has been developed exploring potential feedback of visual, vestibular and arm proprioceptive cues. The identified rider control parameters, after model reduction, stabilize the system and mimic realistic rider control behavior. The feedback gains of this control model were used to identify the specific optimal control linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) cost function which the rider was using to control the bicycle. The identified cost functions indicate that at low speed the rider minimizes his control effort and at high speed he minimizes the heading error.},
