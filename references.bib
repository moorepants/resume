  abstract = {Conventional wisdom and anecdote suggests that testing takes between 30 to 50\% of a project's effort. However testing is not a monolithic activity as it consists of a number of different phases such as unit testing, integration testing and finally system and acceptance test. Unit testing has received a lot of criticism in terms of the amount of time that it is perceived to take and its perceived costs. However it still remains an important verification activity being an effective means to test individual software components for boundary value behavior and ensure that all code has been exercised adequately. We examine the available data from three safety-related, industrial software projects that have made use of unit testing. Using this information we argue that the perceived costs of unit testing may be exaggerated and that the likely benefits in terms of defect detection are quite high in relation to those costs. We also discuss the different issues that have been found applying the technique at different phases of the development and using different methods to generate those tests. We also compare results we have obtained with empirical results from the literature and highlight some possible weakness of research in this area.},

Results show that the stiffness and damping parameters of the waist do not strongly affect bicycle stability. Uncontrolled arm stiffness has a very detrimental effect on stability and destroys the self-stabilization mechanism. Arm damping has a more complex effect and reduces the self-stability region.},

  abstract = {A three-dimensional, neuromusculoskeletal model of the body was combined with dynamic optimization theory to simulate normal walking on level ground. The body was modeled as a 23 degree-of-freedom mechanical linkage, actuated by 54 muscles. The dynamic optimization problem was to calculate the muscle excitation histories, muscle forces, and limb motions subject to minimum metabolic energy expenditure per unit distance traveled. Muscle metabolic energy was calculated by summing five terms: the basal or resting heat, activation heat, maintenance heat, shortening heat, and the mechanical work done by all the muscles in the model. The gait cycle was assumed to be symmetric; that is, the muscle excitations for the right and left legs and the initial and terminal states in the model were assumed to be equal. Importantly, a tracking problem was not solved. Rather, only a set of terminal constraints was placed on the states of the model to enforce repeatability of the gait cycle. Quantitative comparisons of the model predictions with patterns of body-segmental displacements, ground-reaction forces, and muscle activations obtained from experiment show that the simulation reproduces the salient features of normal gait. The simulation results suggest that minimum metabolic energy per unit distance traveled is a valid measure of walking performance.},

Evidence for the effectiveness of cycle helmets has relied either on simplified experiments or complex statistical analysis of patient cohorts or populations. This study directly assesses the effectiveness of cycle helmets over a range of accident scenarios, from basic loss of control to vehicle impact, using computational modelling.

Simulations were performed using dynamics modelling software (MADYMO) and models of a 50\% Hybrid III dummy, a hybrid cross bicycle and a car. Loss of control was simulated by a sudden turn of the handlebars and striking a curb, side and rear-on impacts by a car were also simulated. Simulations were run over a representative range of cycle speeds (2.0\textendash{}14.0 m s-1) and vehicle speeds (4.5\textendash{}17.9 m s-1).

Bicycle helmets were found to be effective in reducing the severity of head injuries sustained in common accidents. They reduced the risk of an AIS \&gt; 3 injury, in cases with head impacts, by an average of 40\%. In accidents that would cause up to moderate (AIS = 2) injuries to a non-helmeted rider, helmets eliminated the risk of injury. Helmets were also found to be effective in preventing fatal head injuries in some instances. The effectiveness of helmets was demonstrated over the entire range of cycle speeds studied, up to and including 14 m s-1. There was no evidence that helmet wearing increased the risk of neck injury, indeed helmets were found to be protective of neck injuries in many cases. Similarly, helmets were found to offer an increase in protection even when an increase in cycle speed due to risk compensation was taken into consideration.},

  abstract = {We describe how human equilibrium control principles, which were derived from neurophysiological experiments, can be implemented in a biped humanoid robot (`PostuRob'). Stance control in humans uses sensorbased feedback which involves mainly three sensors that measure: (1) body motion in space (vestibular system), (2) body motion with respect to the feet (ankle angle proprioception), and (3) torque between body and feet (ankle torque proprioception). The sensor signals are not used directly for feedback, but instead are used to internally reconstruct the physical stimuli in the outside world by means of sensor fusions. These reconstructions yield internal estimates of the external force fields such as gravity, the external contact forces (e.g. push), and support surface motion. The estimates are fed into an ankle angle proprioceptive feedback loop. By way of the signal fusions the robot's control adjusts to the external stimulus situations, a fact that allows for low loop gain and robust control. This control differs from that of the biped robots described in the literature. They tend to use a global stability measure such as the COP (centre of pressure) or ZMP (zero moment point) and this control does not adjust to the external stimulus situation. Our PostuRob is used in a biorobotics approach to better understand stance control deficits of neurological patients and the effects of therapy and rehabilitation.},

  shorttitle = {Summary of the {{First Workshop}} on {{Sustainable Software}} for {{Science}}},
  abstract = {Challenges related to development, deployment, and maintenance of reusable software for science are becoming a growing concern. Many scientists' research increasingly depends on the quality and availability of software upon which their works are built. To highlight some of these issues and share experiences, the First Workshop on Sustainable Software for Science: Practice and Experiences (WSSSPE1) was held in Nov. 2013 in conjunction with the SC13 Conference. The workshop featured keynote presentations and a large number (54) of solicited extended abstracts that were grouped into three themes and presented via panels. A set of collaborative notes of the presentations and discussion was taken during the workshop. Unique perspectives were captured about issues such as comprehensive documentation, development and deployment practices, software licenses and career paths for developers. Attribution systems that accounts for evidence of software contribution and impact were also discussed. These include mechanisms such as Dig. Obj. IDs (DOIs), publication of software papers, and the use of online systems, for example source code repositories like GitHub. For truly sustainable software, there should be no endpoint, as the software products continue to be used beyond a single institution, grant, and developer or development team. This paper summarizes the issues and shared experiences that were discussed, including cross-cutting issues and use cases. It joins a nascent literature seeking to understand what drives software work in science, and how it is impacted by the reward systems of science. These incentives can determine the extent to which developers are motivated to build software for the long-term, for the use of others, and whether to work collaboratively or separately. It also explores community building, leadership, and dynamics in relation to successful scientific software.},

  abstract = {Studies on the reflex modulation of vertebrate locomotion have been conducted in many different laboratories and with many different preparations: for example, lamprey swimming, bird flight, quadrupedal walking in cats and bipedal walking in humans. Emerging concepts are that reflexes are task-, phase- and context-dependent. To function usefully in a behaviour such as locomotion wherein initial conditions change from step to step, reflexes would have to show modulation.

Papers are reviewed in which the study of different reflexes have been conducted during different behaviours, with an emphasis on experiments in humans. A framework is developed in which the modulation and flexibility of reflexes are demonstrated. Alterations in cutaneous, and muscle (stretch and load receptor) reflexes between sitting, standing and walking are discussed. Studies in which both electrical, mechanical and `natural' receptor activation have been conducted during walking are reviewed.

Reflexes are shown to have important regulatory functions during human locomotion. A framework for discussion of reflex function throughout the step cycle is developed. The function of a given reflex pathway changes dynamically throughout the locomotor cycle. While all reflexes act in concert to a certain extent, generally cutaneous reflexes act to alter swing limb trajectory to avoid stumbling and falling.

Stretch reflexes act to stabilize limb trajectory and assist force production during stance. Load receptor reflexes are shown to have an effect on both stance phase body weight support and step cycle timing. After neurotrauma or in disease, reflexes no longer function as during normal locomotion, but still have the potential to be clinically exploited in gait modification regimens.},

  doi = {10.1109/EMBC.2013.6610831},
  abstract = {Many functional tasks require regulating appropriate forces or torques even under unpredictable disturbances. However, how this regulation can be achieved remains poorly understood. Limb impedance describes the relationship between externally imposed displacements to the limb and the changes in force or torque generated in response. Low limb impedance is preferred during torque regulation tasks. However, low-frequency impedance increases with muscle activation, which is counterproductive to torque regulation. The purpose of this study was to quantify the ability to voluntarily reduce limb impedance during torque regulation tasks, and to assess if the observed performance is near optimal given the challenges posed by activation-dependent muscle properties and time delays in the neuromuscular system. By examining elbow impedance measured in experiments and predicted by a biomechanical model with an optimal controller, our results demonstrated that individuals can reduce the low-frequency components (below 1Hz) of elbow impedance during forceful contractions, and that this performance is similar to those predicted by an optimal feedback controller. These findings suggest that neural feedback can compensate for intrinsic muscle properties in a near-optimal manner, thereby allowing torque to be regulated at frequencies below 1 Hz.},

In this study, we quantify the changes that occurred as 10 subjects with disabilities learned to ride traditional bicycles during a specialized bicycle training camp. These changes are revealed by three synchronized wireless inertial measurement units (IMUs) used to measure bicycle kinematics. Out of 10 subjects, 6 were successful in riding a traditional bicycle without assistance by the end of the camp. The peak value of the cross-correlation between steer and roll angular velocities was significantly greater for riders who ultimately succeeded in riding a traditional bike without assistance. This finding suggests that rider learning can be quantified by increased correlation between bicycle steer rate and roll rate. In essence, learning to steer in the direction of lean is an essential skill in learning to ride a bicycle.},

  abstract = {The ankle contributes the majority of mechanical power during walking and is a frequently studied joint in biomechanics. Specifically, researchers have extensively investigated the torque-angle relationship for the ankle during dynamic tasks, such as walking and running. The slope of this relationship has been termed the ``quasi-stiffness.'' However, over time, researchers have begun to interchange the concepts of quasi-stiffness and stiffness. This is an especially important distinction as researchers currently begin to investigate the appropriate control systems for recently developed powered prosthetic legs. The quasi-stiffness and stiffness are distinct concepts in the context of powered joints, and are equivalent in the context of passive joints. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the difference between the stiffness and quasi-stiffness using a simple impedance-controlled inverted pendulum model and a more sophisticated biped walking model, each with the ability to modify the trajectory of an impedance controller's equilibrium angle position. In both cases, stiffness values are specified by the controller and the quasi-stiffness are shown during a single step. Both models have widely varying quasi-stiffness but each have a single stiffness value. Therefore, from this simple modeling approach, the differences and similarities between these two concepts are elucidated.},

  abstract = {Accurate predictions of species abundance remain one of the most vexing challenges in ecology. This observation is perhaps unsurprising, because population dynamics are often strongly forced and highly nonlinear. Recently, however, numerous statistical techniques have been proposed for fitting highly parameterized mechanistic models to complex time series, potentially providing the machinery necessary for generating useful predictions. Alternatively, there is a wide variety of comparatively simple model-free forecasting methods that could be used to predict abundance. Here we pose a rather conservative challenge and ask whether a correctly specified mechanistic model, fit with commonly used statistical techniques, can provide better forecasts than simple model-free methods for ecological systems with noisy nonlinear dynamics. Using four different control models and seven experimental time series of flour beetles, we found that Markov chain Monte Carlo procedures for fitting mechanistic models often converged on best-fit parameterizations far different from the known parameters. As a result, the correctly specified models provided inaccurate forecasts and incorrect inferences. In contrast, a model-free method based on state-space reconstruction gave the most accurate short-term forecasts, even while using only a single time series from the multivariate system. Considering the recent push for ecosystem-based management and the increasing call for ecological predictions, our results suggest that a flexible model-free approach may be the most promising way forward.},

During this task, the subjects carried, and could look at, a stopwatch that counted down to zero. As expected, if the total time available were large, humans walk the whole distance. If the time available were small, humans mostly run. For an intermediate total time, humans often use a mixture of walking at a slow speed and running at a higher speed.

  abstract = {Stiffness, the relationship between applied load and elastic deformation, is an important neuromechanical component related to muscular performance and injury risk. The free-oscillation technique is a popular method for stiffness assessment. There has been wide application of this technique assessing a variety of musculature, including the triceps surae, knee flexors, knee extensors and pectorals. The methodology involves the modelling of the system as a linear damped mass-spring system. The use of such a model has certain advantages and limitations that will be discussed within this review. Perhaps the major advantage of such a model is the specificity of the measure, whereby it is possible for the assessment conditions to simulate the type of loading witnessed during functional tasks and sporting situations. High levels of reliability and construct validity have typically been reported using such procedures. Despite these assurances of accuracy, a number of issues have also been identified. The literature reveals some concerns surrounding the use of a linear model for stiffness assessment. Further, procedural issues surrounding the administration of the perturbation, attention focus of the participant during the perturbation, signal collection, data processing and analysis, presentation of stiffness as a linear or torsional value, assessment load (single vs multiple vs maximal) and the stiffness-load relationship have been identified, and are all fundamentally related to the quality of the calculated output data. Finally, several important considerations for practitioners have been recommended to ensure the quality and consistency of stiffness data collection, processing and interpretation.},

We found that passive stiffness of the affected ankle joint was significantly higher in chronic stroke survivors than in healthy adults of a similar cohort, both in the sagittal as well as frontal plane of movement, in three out of four directions tested with indistinguishable stiffness values in plantarflexion direction. Our findings are comparable to the literature, thus indicating its plausibility, and, to our knowledge, report for the first time passive stiffness in the frontal plane for persons with chronic stroke and older healthy adults.},

  abstract = {With the advent of multi-core processors, parallel execution of multiple tasks has become a common practice. Various scheduling algorithms have addressed this issue considering multiprocessor systems. Most of these algorithms target application level parallelism. Task level parallelism within an application can be exploited using shared memory architecture such as multi-core processor or in a distributed computing environment. In this paper, we propose a static scheduling algorithm that generates a schedule that can be optimized for one or all parameters including execution time, number of processors, and efficiency of processors. The input to this scheduler is a task dependency matrix is generated using dependency analysis technique. Efficiency of this scheduler is high because it uses multiple parameters such as task wait time, number of tasks whose dependency gets resolved by scheduling a task, and task execution time. The paper concludes with an example of applying this technique to a set of tasks.},

  abstract = {Lancet is a new, simulator-independent Python utility for succinctly specifying, launching, and collating results from large batches of interrelated computationally demanding program runs. This paper demonstrates how to combine Lancet with IPython Notebook to provide a flexible, lightweight, and agile workflow for fully reproducible scientific research. This informal and pragmatic approach uses IPython Notebook to capture the steps in a scientific computation as it is gradually automated and made ready for publication, without mandating the use of any separate application that can constrain scientific exploration and innovation. The resulting notebook concisely records each step involved in even very complex computational processes that led to a particular figure or numerical result, allowing the complete chain of events to be replicated automatically. Lancet was originally designed to help solve problems in computational neuroscience, such as analyzing the sensitivity of a complex simulation to various parameters, or collecting the results from multiple runs with different random starting points. However, because it is never possible to know in advance what tools might be required in future tasks, Lancet has been designed to be completely general, supporting any type of program as long as it can be launched as a process and can return output in the form of files. For instance, Lancet is also heavily used by one of the authors in a separate research group for launching batches of microprocessor simulations. This general design will allow Lancet to continue supporting a given research project even as the underlying approaches and tools change.},

Under the standard paradigm, the closed-loop system is perturbed (input), measurements are taken (output), and the relationship between input and output reveals features of the system under study. Here we show that under common assumptions made about such systems (e.g. the system implements optimal control with a penalty on mechanical, but not sensory, states) important aspects of the neural controller (its zeros mask the modes of the sensors) remain hidden from standard system identification techniques. Only by perturbing or measuring the closed-loop system ``between'' the sensor and the control can these features be exposed with closed-loop system identification methods; while uncommon, there exist noninvasive techniques such as galvanic vestibular stimulation that perturb between sensor and controller in this way.},

  abstract = {The goal of the Human Power Team from the TU Delft and the Free University of Amsterdam is to break the world speed record in unpaced cycling (Sam Whittingham, 133.28 km/h). The design of such a faired recumbent bicycle is a challenge. The Delft design, called VeloX (Human Power Team (2013)), is a fully-faired monocoque front-driven recumbent bicycle, with minimized air drag and maximized space for a big and strong athlete. However, front driven bicycles have the disadvantage that the front driving induces unwanted steering and that the frontal area of the bicycle cannot be reduced any further. A solution would be rear-wheel steering. A common thought is that a rear-wheel steered bicycle cannot be laterally self-stable, and therefore hard to control. However, recent research (Knoll et al. (2012)) has shown that one can design a rear-wheel steered bicycle which shows a stable forward speed range.

Based on these results a rear-wheel steered recumbent bicycle has been designed, within the existing design constraints. Although not self-stable, this design shows a mildly lateral unstable behavior in the desired forward speed range of 0 to 40 m/s (0 to 144 km/h). Computer simulations demonstrate that the bicycle can be stabilized by adding a human controller model (Schwab et al. (2013)) to the bicycle model. For a set of expected lateral perturbations (side wind perturbations) it is shown that rider steer torque stays within human bounds, both in magnitude and in frequency. Future work is dedicated to building and testing a prototype of the design.},

  abstract = {The bicycle provides transportation for leisure, recreation, and travel between home and work, throughout the world, in big cities as well as in small villages, supporting human mobility for more than a century. Modeling, analysis, and control of bicycle dynamics has been an attractive area of research in the last century as well as in recent years. Bicycle dynamics has attracted the attention of the automatic control research community because of its peculiar features, such as, for example, the fact that it depends strongly on the bicycle speed and that, under certain conditions, it exhibits both open right-half plane poles and zeros, making the design of feedback controllers for either balancing the bicycle in the upright position or moving it along a predefined path a challenging problem. In this article, the LPV nature of the bicycle dynamics is exploited to design a control system that automatically balances a riderless bicycle in the upright position. More precisely, the problem is formulated as the design of an LPV state-feedback controller that guarantees stability of this two-wheeled vehicle when the speed varies within a given range and its derivative is bounded.},

This predictive association between vision and action likely underlies modulatory effects of action on visual processing. However, it is unknown whether actions can have generative effects on visual perception. We asked whether, in total darkness, self-generated body movements are sufficient to evoke normally concomitant visual perceptions. Using a deceptive experimental design, we discovered that waving one's own hand in front of one's covered eyes can cause visual sensations of motion. Conjecturing that these visual sensations arise from multisensory connectivity, we showed that grapheme-color synesthetes experience substantially stronger kinesthesis-induced visual sensations than nonsynesthetes do. Finally, we found that the perceived vividness of kinesthesis-induced visual sensations predicted participants' ability to smoothly track self-generated hand movements with their eyes in darkness, which indicates that these sensations function like typical retinally driven visual sensations. Evidently, even in the complete absence of external visual input, the brain predicts visual consequences of actions.},

The model analysis provides a better understanding of the contributions of possible intrinsic and reflexive components of arm impedance, makes clear the limitations of second-order mass-viscosity-stiffness models and reveals possible task effects on the impedance. The musculoskeletal model describes planar movements of the upper arm and forearm, which are moved by six lumped muscles with nonlinear dynamics. The motor control system is represented by a neural network which combines feedforward and feedback control. It is optimized for the control of movements or for posture control in the presence of external forces. The achieved impedance characteristics depend on the conditions during the learning process. In particular, the impedance is adapted in a suitable way to the frequency content and direction of external forces acting on the hand during an isometric task. The impedance characteristics of a model, which is optimized for movement control, are similar to experimental data in the literature. The achieved stiffness is, to a large extent, reflexively determined whereas the approximated viscosity is primarily due to intrinsic attributes. It is argued that usually applied Hill-type muscle models do not properly represent intrinsic muscle stiffness.},

  abstract = {Neurological or biomechanical disorders may distort ankle mechanical impedance and thereby impair locomotor function. This paper presents a quantitative characterization of multivariable ankle mechanical impedance of young healthy subjects when their muscles were relaxed, to serve as a baseline to compare with pathophysiological ankle properties of biomechanically and/or neurologically impaired patients. Measurements using a highly backdrivable wearable ankle robot combined with multi-input multi-output stochastic system identification methods enabled reliable characterization of ankle mechanical impedance in two degrees-of-freedom (DOFs) simultaneously, the sagittal and frontal planes. The characterization included important ankle properties unavailable from single DOF studies: coupling between DOFs and anisotropy as a function of frequency. Ankle impedance in joint coordinates showed responses largely consistent with a 2nd order system consisting of inertia, viscosity, and stiffness in both seated (knee flexed) and standing (knee straightened) postures. Stiffness in the sagittal plane was greater than in the frontal plane and furthermore, was greater when standing than when seated, most likely due to the stretch of bi-articular muscles (medial and lateral gastrocnemius). Very low off-diagonal partial coherences implied negligible coupling between dorsiflexion-plantarflexion and inversion-eversion. The directions of principal axes were tilted slightly counterclockwise from the original joint coordinates. The directional variation (anisotropy) of ankle impedance in the 2D-space formed by rotations in the sagittal and frontal planes exhibited a characteristic ``peanut'' shape, weak in inversion-eversion over a wide range of frequencies from the stiffness dominated region up to the inertia dominated region. Implications for the assessment of neurological and biomechanical impairments are discussed.},

A wearable ankle robot with an ensemble-based linear time-varying system identification method enabled identification of transient ankle mechanical impedance in 2 degrees of freedom, both in the sagittal and frontal planes. Several important issues of the ensemble-based identification method in practical measurements are discussed, especially a strategy to solve the limitation of the method which assumes that the system undergoes the same time-varying behavior on every stride. The suggested method was successfully applied to 15 minutes of human walking on a treadmill. Experiments with 10 young healthy subjects showed clear time-varying behavior of ankle impedance across the gait cycle, except the mid-stance phase. Interestingly, most subjects increased ankle impedance just before heel strike in both degrees of freedom. Interpretation of impedance changes was consistent with analysis of electromyographic signals from major muscles related to ankle movements.},

  abstract = {Daily activities, such as walking, may require dynamic modulation of vestibular input onto motoneurons. This dynamic modulation is difficult to identify in humans due to limitations in the delivery and analysis of current vestibular probes, such as galvanic vestibular stimulation. Stochastic vestibular stimulation, however, provides an alternative method to extract human vestibular reflexes. Here, we used time-dependent coherence and time-dependent cross-correlation, coupled with stochastic vestibular stimulation, to investigate the phase dependency of human vestibular reflexes during locomotion. We found that phase-dependent activity from the medial gastrocnemius muscles is correlated with the vestibular signals over the 2- to 20-Hz bandwidth during the stance phase of locomotion. Vestibular-gastrocnemius coherence and time-dependent cross-correlations reached maximums at 21 $\pm$ 4 and 23 $\pm$ 8\% of the step cycle following heel contact and before the period of maximal electromyographic activity (38 $\pm$ 5\%). These results demonstrate 1) the effectiveness of these techniques in extracting the phase-dependent modulation of vestibulomuscular coupling during a cyclic task; 2) that vestibulomuscular coupling is phasically modulated during locomotion; and 3) that the period of strongest vestibulomuscular coupling does not correspond to the period of maximal electromyographic activity in the gastrocnemius. Therefore, we have shown that stochastic vestibular stimulation, coupled with time-frequency decomposition, provides an effective tool to assess the contribution of vestibular ex-afference to the muscular control during locomotion.},

When applied to dynamic musculoskeletal models such optimality principles might be used to predict how a patient's gait adapts to mechanical interventions such as prosthetic devices or surgery. In this paper we study the effects of different performance criteria on predicted gait patterns using a 2D musculoskeletal model. The associated optimal control problem for a family of different cost functions was solved utilizing the direct collocation method. It was found that fatigue-like cost functions produced realistic gait, with stance phase knee flexion, as opposed to energy-related cost functions which avoided knee flexion during the stance phase. We conclude that fatigue minimization may be one of the primary optimality principles governing human gait.},

Wobble denotes a characteristic unstable oscillatory mode dominated by oscillations of the front wheel about the steering axis. The wobble mode of a trekking bicycle at low speeds has already been analysed, where no influence of the rider's hands on the steering system is taken into account. The wobble mode of a racing bicycle at higher speeds has not been addressed in more detail so far. The paper points out the difference between a trekking bicycle and a racing bicycle in particular with respect to the wobble mode. Different geometry, mass and stiffness properties of both types of bicycles and different characteristic positions of the rider are considered. As the wobble at racing bicycles often occurs at high speeds, when riding down a grade with hands on a dropped handlebar, a passive rider model, that takes into account the movement of the rider's arms, is presented.},

  title = {The Mechanics of Twisting Somersaults},
  abstract = {Twisting movements are categorised into three mechanical types,
named as DIRECT, COUNTER-ROTATION and TILT TWIST. Twisting techniques
are studied using mathematical models.
A mathematical inertia model is constructed to enable the
determination of segmental inertia parameters from anthropometric
measurements. A film analysis program is developed so that the angles,
which specify the orientation and configuration of the body, may be
derived from digitised film data. A computer simulation model,
comprising 11 segments and 17 degrees of freedom, is constructed to
represent the human body in free fall. The combined use of the three
computer programs results in maximum errors of 3\% for somersault and
9\% for twist in ten filmed movements.
The mechanics of twisting techniques are explained using simple
mathematical models. An analysis of rigid body motions shows that
there are two distinct modes of motion, named as the ROD MODE and the
DISC MODE. It is shown that it is possible to change from one mode
to the other by varying the angle of pike and this permits the twist
to be increased or stopped or even reversed.
The capacities of twisting techniques are determined using
simulations. For twists from a piked position, delaying the extension
from the pike can increase the twist rate although this does depend
upon the particular technique used and the initial direction of
somersault.
The contributions of twisting techniques used in the filmed
movements are determined using simulations based upon modifications of
the film data. It is found that counter-rotation techniques made
small contributions and that aerial techniques, which increased the
angle of tilt, were the major contributors, even in movements where
the twist was apparent at take off.
Using the simulation model it is shown that the build up of twist
in the unstable double layout somersault may be controlled by means of
small asymmetrical arm movements during flight.},

Optimization is performed using a small set of simple goals, for example, one hand should be on the ground, or the center-of-mass should be above a particular height. These objectives are applied to short spacetime windows which can be composed to express goals over an entire animation. Specific contact locations needed to achieve objectives are not required by our method. We show that the method can synthesize many different kinds of movement, including walking, hand walking, breakdancing, flips, and crawling. Most of these movements have never been previously synthesized by physics-based methods.},

  abstract = {Electrical stimulation is a promising technology for the restoration of arm function in paralysed individuals. Control of the paralysed arm under electrical stimulation, however, is a challenging problem that requires advanced controllers and command interfaces for the user. A real-time model describing the complex dynamics of the arm would allow user-in-the-loop type experiments where the command interface and controller could be assessed. Real-time models of the arm previously described have not included the ability to model the independently controlled scapula and clavicle, limiting their utility for clinical applications of this nature. The goal of this study therefore was to evaluate the performance and mechanical behaviour of a realtime, dynamic model of the arm and shoulder girdle. The model comprises seven segments linked by eleven degrees of freedom and actuated by 138 muscle elements. Polynomials were generated to describe the muscle lines of action to reduce computation time, and an implicit, first-order Rosenbrock formulation of the equations of motion was used to increase simulation step-size. The model simulated flexion of the arm faster than real time, simulation time being 92\% of actual movement time on standard desktop hardware. Modelled maximum isometric torque values agreed well with values from the literature, showing that the model simulates the moment-generating behaviour of a real human arm. The speed of the model enables experiments where the user controls the virtual arm and receives visual feedback in real time. The ability to optimise potential solutions in simulation greatly reduces the burden on the user during development.},

This is shown to be logically untenable, for it indicates that the bodies must exert tension on one another just before separating. Furthermore, it denotes that the damping energy loss is proportional to the square of the impacting velocity, instead of to its cube, as can be deduced from Goldsmith's work. A damping term $\lambda$xn \.{x} is here introduced; for a sphere impacting a plate Hertz gives n = 3/2. The Kelvin-Voigt model is shown to be approximated as a special case deducible from this law, and applicable when impacts are absent. Physical experiments have confirmed this postulate.},

In earlier work we examined the impact of changing CS1 from C++ to Python while leaving CS2 in C++. We found that Python-prepared CS1 students fared no differently in CS2 than students whose CS1 course was in C++, even though CS2 was taught in C++ and covered the same topics as in previous years. Was that an anomaly? What happens in the next tier of courses? When our CS1 was first changed to Python there were many students who had taken CS1 in C++ still in the system. The result is that there is a cadre of students with either CS1 in Python or CS1 in C++ moving together through our curriculum. This one-time occurrence is an opportunity to study the students with many variables fixed. Our next tier of courses is a C-based computer organization course, a C++ based object-oriented software design course, and a data structures course. We found that the students who started with Python fared as well as the CS1 C++ students. As before, the best predictor of performance was their college GPA. Python versus C++ CS1 preparation was not a predictor of performance in any course. We conclude again that in our C++ based curriculum changing CS1 to Python had no negative impact on student performance and did not require any significant change in those subsequent courses.},

There has been increasing interest in performing movement analysis in real-time, to provide immediate feedback to both therapist and patient.

Here we present a software system, named human body model (HBM), to compute joint kinematics and kinetics for a full body model with 44 degrees of freedom, in real-time, and to estimate length changes and forces in 300 muscle elements. HBM was used to analyze lower extremity function during gait in 12 able-bodied subjects. Processing speed exceeded 120 samples per second on standard PC hardware. Joint angles and moments were consistent within the group, and consistent with other studies in the literature. Estimated muscle force patterns were consistent among subjects and agreed qualitatively with electromyography, to the extent that can be expected from a biomechanical model. The real-time analysis was integrated into the D-Flow system for development of custom real-time feedback applications and into the gait real-time analysis interactive lab system for gait analysis and gait retraining.},

This is particularly important when these contact forces are to be used in further calculations, such as an inverse dynamics analysis of joint kinetics. An estimate of the FPIC can be derived using the kinematics of the moving surface and the inertial properties of the force plate. This technique allowed for a reduction of up to 85\% of the peak and integrated FPIC acquired from AMTI (OR6\textendash{}7) force plates during translations of 0.1 m, and surface rotations of 10$^\circ$, using a ramp stimulus of 150 ms duration.},

However, many people tend to avoid riding a bicycle because it is unstable. In order to solve this problem, stabilization control for a bicycle has been investigated.

Two kinds of CADO are proposed in this paper, and the performance of these two observers is compared. The proposed control systems provide higher robustness than does the conventional method. The validity of the proposed methods is confirmed based on the experimental results.},

Finally, various methods for designing CPGs to control specific modes of locomotion will be briefly reviewed. In this process, I will discuss different types of CPG models, the pros and cons of using CPGs with robots, and the pros and cons of using robots as scientific tools.

  abstract = {The ordinary differential equations for musculoskeletal dynamics are often numerically stiff and highly nonlinear. Consequently, simulations require small time steps, and optimal control problems are slow to solve and have poor convergence. In this paper, we present an implicit formulation of musculoskeletal dynamics, which leads to new numerical methods for simulation and optimal control, with the expectation that we can mitigate some of these problems. A first order Rosenbrock method was developed for solving forward dynamic problems using the implicit formulation. It was used to perform real-time dynamic simulation of a complex shoulder arm system with extreme dynamic stiffness. Simulations had an RMS error of only 0.11 degrees in joint angles when running at real-time speed. For optimal control of musculoskeletal systems, a direct collocation method was developed for implicitly formulated models. The method was applied to predict gait with a prosthetic foot and ankle. Solutions were obtained in well under one hour of computation time and demonstrated how patients may adapt their gait to compensate for limitations of a specific prosthetic limb design. The optimal control method was also applied to a state estimation problem in sports biomechanics, where forces during skiing were estimated from noisy and incomplete kinematic data. Using a full musculoskeletal dynamics model for state estimation had the additional advantage that forward dynamic simulations, could be done with the same implicitly formulated model to simulate injuries and perturbation responses. While these methods are powerful and allow solution of previously intractable problems, there are still considerable numerical challenges, especially related to the convergence of gradient-based solvers.},

Automated tuning procedures would make powered prostheses more practical for clinical use. In this study, we developed a novel cyber expert system (CES) that encoded HME tuning decisions as computer rules to auto-tune control parameters for a powered knee (passive ankle) prosthesis. The tuning performance of CES was preliminarily quantified on two able-bodied subjects and two transfemoral amputees. After CES and HME tuning, we observed normative prosthetic knee kinematics and improved or slightly improved gait symmetry and step width within each subject. Compared to HME, the CES tuning procedure required less time and no human intervention. Hence, using CES for auto-tuning prosthesis control was a sound concept, promising to enhance the practical value of powered prosthetic legs. However, the tuning goals of CES might not fully capture those of the HME. This was because we observed that HME tuning reduced trunk sway, while CES sometimes led to slightly increased trunk motion. Additional research is still needed to identify more appropriate tuning objectives for powered prosthetic legs to improve amputees' walking function.},

However, few software packages can visualize and modify the integrality of the data in the C3D file. Our objective was to develop an open-source and multi-platform framework to read, write, modify and visualize data from any motion analysis systems using standard (C3D) and proprietary file formats (used by many companies producing motion capture systems). The Biomechanical ToolKit (BTK) was developed to provide cost-effective and efficient tools for the biomechanical community to easily deal with motion analysis data. A large panel of operations is available to read, modify and process data through C++ API, bindings for high-level languages (Matlab, Octave, and Python), and standalone application (Mokka). All these tools are open-source and cross-platform and run on all major operating systems (Windows, Linux, MacOS X).},

  abstract = {This paper presents an equation of motion for numerical simulation of constrained mechanical systems with holonomic and nonholonomic constraints. In order to avoid the error accumulation typically experienced in such simulations, the standard equation of motion is enhanced with embedded force and impulse terms which perform continuous constraint and energy correction along the numerical solution. To avoid interference between the kinematic constraint correction and the energy correction terms, both are derived by taking the geometry of the constrained dynamics rigorously into account. In this light, enforcement of the (ideal) holonomic and nonholonomic kinematic constraints are performed using ideal forces and impulses, while the energy conservation law is considered as a nonideal nonlinear nonholonomic constraint on the simulated motion, and as such it is enforced with nonideal forces. As derived, the equation can be directly discretized and integrated with an explicit ODE solver avoiding the need for expensive implicit integration and iterative constraint stabilization. Application of the proposed equation is demonstrated on a representative example. A more elaborate discussion of practical implementation is presented in Part II of this work.},

Here, we show that the experimental metabolic cost of walking sideways, per unit distance, is over three times that of forward walking. We explain this high metabolic cost with a simple mathematical model; sideways walking is expensive because it involves repeated starting and stopping. When walking sideways, our subjects preferred a low natural speed, averaging 0.575 m s-1 (0.123 s.d.). Even with no prior practice, this preferred sideways walking speed is close to the metabolically optimal speed, averaging 0.610 m s-1 (0.064 s.d.). Subjects were within 2.4\% of their optimal metabolic cost per distance. Thus, we argue that sideways walking is avoided because it is expensive and slow, and it is slow because the optimal speed is low, not because humans cannot move sideways fast.},

The framework combines a flexible body formalism, specifically, the absolute nodal coordinate formulation (ANCF), with a discrete continuous contact force model to address many-body dynamics problems, i.e., problems with hundreds of thousands of rigid and deformable bodies. Since the computational effort associated with these problems is significant, the analytical framework is implemented to leverage the computational power available on today's commodity graphical processing unit (GPU) cards. The framework developed is validated against commercial and research finite element software. The robustness and efficiency of this approach is demonstrated through numerical simulations. The resulting simulation capability is shown to result in 2 orders of magnitude shorter simulation times for systems with a large number of flexible beams that might typically be encountered in hair or polymer simulations.},

  abstract = {Although it is generally accepted that visual information guides steering, it is still unclear whether a curvature matching strategy or a `look where you are going' strategy is used while steering through a curved road. The current experiment investigated to what extent the existing models for curve driving also apply to cycling around a curve, and tested the influence of cycling speed on steering and gaze behavior. Twenty-five participants were asked to cycle through a semicircular lane three consecutive times at three different speeds while staying in the center of the lane. The observed steering behavior suggests that an anticipatory steering strategy was used at curve entrance and a compensatory strategy was used to steer through the actual bend of the curve. A shift of gaze from the center to the inside edge of the lane indicates that at low cycling speed, the `look where you are going' strategy was preferred, while at higher cycling speeds participants seemed to prefer the curvature matching strategy. Authors suggest that visual information from both steering strategies contributes to the steering system and can be used in a flexible way. Based on a familiarization effect, it can be assumed that steering is not only guided by vision but that a short-term learning component should also be taken into account.},

However, only a few affordable, passive prosthetic knee devices in the market have been designed to enable normative gait and to meet the unique daily life needs of above-knee amputees in the developing world. This paper builds upon our past study, which established optimal mechanical component coefficients in prosthetic knee function required for achieving able-bodied kinematics. We present a mechanism for the design of a fully passive prosthetic knee device, which aims to facilitate able-bodied kinematics at a low metabolic cost. The mechanism is implemented using an automatic early stance lock for stability, a linear spring for early stance flexion-extension and a differential friction damping system for late stance and swing control. For preliminary validation of the knee mechanism, we carried out a field trial on two above-knee amputees in India, which showed satisfactory performance of the early stance lock and enabled smooth stance to swing transition by timely initiation of late stance flexion.},

  abstract = {Recent observations of a bicyclist riding through town and on a treadmill show that the rider uses the upper body very little when performing normal maneuvers and that the bicyclist may, in fact, primarily use steering input for control. The observations also revealed that other motions such as lateral movement of the knees were used in low speed stabilization. In order to validate the hypothesis that there is little upper body motion during casual cycling, an in-depth motion capture analysis was performed on the bicycle and rider system. We used motion capture technology to record the motion of three similar young adult male riders riding two different city bicycles on a treadmill. Each rider rode each bicycle while performing stability trials at speeds ranging from 2 km/h to 30 km/h: stabilizing while pedaling normally, stabilizing without pedaling, line tracking while pedaling, and stabilizing with no-hands. These tasks were chosen with the intent of examining differences in the kinematics at various speeds, the effects of pedaling on the system, upper body control motions and the differences in tracking and stabilization. Principal component analysis was used to transform the data into a manageable set organized by the variance associated with the principal components. In this paper, these principal components were used to characterize various distinct kinematic motions that occur during stabilization with and without pedaling. These motions were grouped on the basis of correlation and conclusions were drawn about which motions are candidates for stabilization-related control actions.},

  abstract = {Balance recovery during walking requires complex sensory-motor integration. Mechanisms to avoid falls are active concomitantly with human locomotion motor patterns. It has been suggested that gait can be described by a set of motor modules (synergies), but little is known on the modularity of gait during recovery of balance due to unexpected slips. Our hypothesis was that muscular activation during reactive recovery of balance during gait has a modular organization. The aim of the study was to verify this hypothesis when perturbations were delivered in different directions. Eight healthy men walked on a 7-m walkway, which had a moveable force platform embedded in the middle. Subjects experienced unperturbed walking as well as perturbations delivered in the sagittal (forward and backward) and frontal (leftward and rightward) planes. Bilateral full-body kinematics and surface electromyography (EMG) from lower limbs, trunk, and neck were recorded during walking. Synergies and activation signals were extracted from surface EMG signals. Four modules were sufficient to explain the unperturbed gait and the gait perturbed in any of the perturbation directions. Moreover, three of four modules extracted from the unperturbed gait were the same for gait perturbed forward, leftward, and rightward (similarity in synergies = 0.94 $\pm$ 0.03). On the other hand, the activation signals were different between unperturbed and perturbed gait (average correlation coefficient = 0.55 $\pm$ 0.16). These strategies to recover balance were robust across subjects. In conclusion, changes in lower limb and trunk kinematics provoked by perturbations were reflected in minimal adjustments in the muscular modular organization of walking, with three of four modules preserved from normal walking. Conversely, the activation signals were all substantially influenced by the perturbations, being the result of integration of afferent information and supraspinal control.},

Bicycle and rider mechanics have been modeled using the Whipple bicycle model extended with the rider inertia. A rider control model applying steering torque at the handle bars has been developed exploring potential feedback of visual, vestibular and arm proprioceptive cues. The identified rider control parameters, after model reduction, stabilize the system and mimic realistic rider control behavior. The feedback gains of this control model were used to identify the specific optimal control linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) cost function which the rider was using to control the bicycle. The identified cost functions indicate that at low speed the rider minimizes his control effort and at high speed he minimizes the heading error.},

  abstract = {Numerous rules-of-thumb have been suggested for determining the minimum number of subjects required to conduct multiple regression analyses. These rules-of-thumb are evaluated by comparing their results against those based on power analyses for tests of hypotheses of multiple and partial correlations. The results did not support the use of rules-of-thumb that simply specify some constant (e.g., 100 subjects) as the minimum number of subjects or a minimum ratio of number of subjects (N) to number of predictors (m). Some support was obtained for a rule-of-thumb that N $\geq$ 50 + 8 m for the multiple correlation and N $\geq$104 + m for the partial correlation. However, the rule-of-thumb for the multiple correlation yields values too large for N when m $\geq$ 7, and both rules-of-thumb assume all studies have a medium-size relationship between criterion and predictors. Accordingly, a slightly more complex rule-of thumb is introduced that estimates minimum sample size as function of effect size as well as the number of predictors. It is argued that researchers should use methods to determine sample size that incorporate effect size.},

There are three input terms and they can be identified as the three mechanisms by which balance can be maintained: (1) by moving the centre of pressure with respect to the vertical projection of the CoM, (2) by counter-rotating segments around the CoM, and (3) by applying an external force, other than the ground reaction force.
For the first two mechanisms the respective contributions to CoM acceleration can be obtained from force plate recordings. This is illustrated by some example data from experiments, which show that the contribution from mechanism 2 can be considerable, e.g. in one-legged standing.},

The system can take three inputs from the bicycle: the pedaling speed, the direction of the handles, and the location of the center of pressure on the supporting base of the bicycle. These inputs allow user interactions with a virtual environment that increase motivation of the user. A series of experiments were conducted with three different visual feedback conditions: without visual feedback of balance information; with visual feedback of weight shift; or with visual feedback of the center of pressure. The assessment of balance parameters obtained from the experiments showed the improvement of balance capability on the bicycle. Especially, the visual feedback of weight shift most increased the effectiveness of the training. The findings suggest that the system might be used as a balance and motor function rehabilitation system with further objective measurements of balance ability of the patients in longer terms.},

  abstract = {The vestibulocollic (VCR) and cervicocollic (CCR) reflexes are essential to stabilize the head-neck system and to deal with unexpected disturbances. This study investigates how neck reflexes contribute to stabilization and modulate with perturbation properties. We hypothesized that VCR and CCR modulate with the bandwidth of the perturbation and that this modulation is maintained across amplitudes and influenced by the eyes being open or closed. Seated subjects were perturbed in an anterior-posterior direction. The perturbations varied in bandwidth from 0.3 Hz to a maximum of 1.2, 2.0, 4.0, and 8.0 Hz, at three amplitudes, and with eyes open and closed. Frequency response functions of head kinematics and neck muscle EMG demonstrated substantial changes with bandwidth and vision and minor changes with amplitude, which through closed-loop identification were attributed to neural (reflexive) modulation. Results suggest that both reflexes were attenuated when perturbations exceeded the system's natural frequency, thereby shifting from a head-in-space to a head-on-trunk stabilization tendency. Additionally, results indicate that reflexive and mechanical stiffness marginally exceed the negative stiffness due to gravity; a stabilization strategy which minimizes effort. With eyes closed, reflexes were attenuated further, presumably due to a reduced ability to discriminate self-motion, driving the system to a head-on-trunk stabilization strategy at the highest bandwidth. We conclude that VCR and CCR modulate with perturbation bandwidth and visual feedback conditions to maintain head-upright posture, but are invariant across amplitude changes.},

An ensemble-based system identification method was used to investigate the time-varying behavior of ankle mechanical impedance in two degrees of freedom, both in the sagittal and frontal planes. We also provide solutions to overcome the limitations of original ensemble-based methods in practical applications. A pilot study of three human subjects demonstrated the efficacy of our approach. Analysis results showed clear time-varying behaviors of ankle impedance across the gait cycle except in the mid- and terminal-stance phases, and these behaviors were accurately approximated as a second-order model with stiffness, damping, and inertia components. Interestingly, all three subjects showed similar time-varying behaviors in both degrees of freedom: impedance increased around heel-strike and decreased significantly at the end of the stance phase.},

  doi = {10.1007/s11044-013-9397-0},
  abstract = {Efficient dynamic simulation code is essential in many situations (including hardware-in-the-loop and model-predictive control applications), and highly beneficial in others (such as design optimization, sensitivity analysis, parameter identification, and controller tuning tasks). When the number of modeling coordinates n exceeds the degrees-of-freedom of the system f, as is often the case when closed kinematic chains are present, the governing dynamic equations consist of n second-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) coupled with m=n-f algebraic constraint equations. This set of n+m index-3 differential-algebraic equations can be difficult to solve in an efficient yet accurate manner. Embedding (or generalized coordinate partitioning) can be used to obtain f ODEs (one for each independent acceleration), which are generally more amenable to numerical integration; however, the dependent positions are typically computed from the independent positions at each time step. Newton\textendash{}Raphson iteration is often used for solving the position-level kinematics, but only provides solutions to within a specified tolerance, and can require several iterations to converge. In this work, Gr\"obner bases are used to obtain recursively solvable symbolic solutions for the dependent positions, which can then be evaluated to within machine precision using a fixed number of arithmetic operations. Natural coordinates are particularly attractive in this context, since the resulting constraint equations are maximally quadratic polynomials and are, therefore, easily triangularized. The proposed approach is suitable for use in an automated formulation procedure and, as demonstrated by three examples, is capable of generating highly efficient simulation code with minimal additional effort required at the formulation stage.},

It will be driven by a number of specific developments including: the digitization of content; the development of print repositories; the development of e-readers and print-on-demand publishing; the growth of open access; challenges to establish academic publishing organizations; and the growth of new forms of scholarship based on openness and social productivity. If academic libraries are to be successful, they will need to: deconstruct legacy print collections; move from item-by-item book selection to purchase-on-demand and subscriptions; manage the transition to open access journals; focus on curating unique items; and develop new mechanisms for funding national infrastructure.
Different parts of the Ocean contained different sorts of stories, and as all the stories that had ever been told and many that were still in the process of being invented could be found here, the Ocean of the Streams of Story was in fact the biggest library in the universe. And because the stories were held here in fluid form, they retained the ability to change, to become new versions of themselves, to join up with other stories and so become yet other stories; so that unlike a library of books the Ocean of the Streams of Story was much more than a storeroom of yarns. It was not dead but alive.

A two-stage approach to the identification of a single-input single-output control system is used: first, the closed-loop frequency response is derived using the periodic property of the experimental data, followed by the fitting of a parametric model. While this approach is well-established for non-predictive and predictive control, it is here used for the first time with intermittent predictive control. This technique is applied to data from experiments with human volunteers who use one of two control strategies, focusing either on position or on velocity, to manually control a virtual, unstable load which requires sustained feedback to maintain position or low velocity. The results show firstly that the non-predictive controller does not fit the data as well as the other two models, and secondly that the predictive and intermittent predictive controllers provide equally good models which cannot be distinguished using this approach. Importantly, the second observation implies that sustained visual manual control is compatible with intermittent control, and that previous results suggesting a continuous control model for the human control system do not rule out intermittent control as an alternative hypothesis. Thirdly, the parameters identified reflect the control strategy adopted by the human controller.},

Basketball rebound regions are estimated using a dynamic model for short-, medium-, and long-range direct and bank shots and with previously measured standard deviations of release velocity and angle. The model includes basketball stiffness and damping, and contains flight and ball-contact sub-models. The deterministic simulations, together with random Gaussian probability density functions for release velocity, angle and lateral deviation angle, analyze ball trajectories from different shot positions. The results instruct likely rebounding positions. Angled direct and bank shots from the same release position usually have two high-probability rebound positions, one on the same side as and one on the opposite side from the shooter. The highest probability rebound position is typically in or near the optimal shot path plane for capture. Rebound positions from skilled player's shots are usually more predictable.},

As a result, teams may question the economic value of instituting such a practice. One large Microsoft team consisting of 32 developers transitioned from ad hoc and individualized unit testing practices to the utilization of the NUnit automated unit testing framework by all members of the team. These automated unit tests were typically written by developers after they completed coding functionality, approximately every two to three days. After a period of one year of utilizing this automated unit testing practice on Version 2 of a product, the team realized a 20.9\% decrease in test defects at a cost of approximately 30\% more development time relative to Version 1 of the product. The product also had a relative decrease in defects found by customers during the first two years of field use. Comparatively, other industrial teams have experienced larger decreases in defects when automated unit tests are written iteratively, as is done with the test driven development practice, for a similar time increase. These results indicate automated unit testing is beneficial but additional quality improvements may be realized if the tests are written iteratively.},

Although these data are the only available and comprehensive set of inertial parameters regarding young adult Caucasians, they have been rarely utilized for biomechanical analyses of subjects belonging to the same or a similar population. The main reason is probably that Zatsiorsky et al. used bony landmarks as reference points for locating segment CMs and defining segment lengths. Some of these landmarks were markedly distant from the joint centers currently used by most researchers as reference points. The purpose of this study was to adjust the mean relative CM positions and radii of gyration reported by Zatsiorsky et al., in order to reference them to the joint centers or other commonly used landmarks, rather than the original landmarks. The adjustments were based on a number of carefully selected sources of anthropometric data.},

  abstract = {A system for the measurement of forces in noninertial reference systems, and a possible solution to compensate force plate readings by means of accelerometers were investigated. If the force plate can be considered a rigid body, six linear accelerometers can measure all linear and angular accelerations of the instrument in 3-D space. However, by using nine accelerometers in a proper layout, the force and moment generated by the movement of the plate can be quantified in a way that eliminates the errors due to the time integration of the accelerations. By doing so, no temporal limits are imposed to the compensation. A one degree of freedom numerical model was implemented to evaluate the importance of main error sources in the estimation of inertial forces using accelerometers with different technical characteristics. The inertial compensation of the force plate along one axis was tested, and the performances of a piezoelectric accelerometer and a capacitive accelerometer were compared. With the proposed inertially compensated force plate, accelerations up to 5 g's in amplitude and frequencies from 0 to 100 Hz can be compensated by means of capacitive accelerometers. Such a device can be used for force measurements in moving vehicles, or any situation where the surface on which the instrument is mounted is moving or vibrating.},

  abstract = {Dynamic joint stiffness defines the dynamic relationship between the position of a joint and the torque acting about it and can be separated into intrinsic and reflex components. Under stationary conditions, these can be identified using a nonlinear parallel-cascade algorithm that models intrinsic stiffness-a linear dynamic response to position-and reflex stiffness-a nonlinear dynamic response to velocity-as parallel pathways. Experiments using this method show that both intrinsic and reflex stiffness depend strongly on the operating point, defined by position and torque, likely because of some underlying nonlinear behavior not modeled by the parallel-cascade structure. Consequently, both intrinsic and reflex stiffness will appear to be time-varying whenever the operating point changes rapidly, as during movement. This paper describes and validates an extension of the parallel-cascade algorithm to time-varying conditions. It describes the ensemble method used to estimate time-varying intrinsic and reflex stiffness. Simulation results demonstrate that the algorithm can track rapid changes in joint stiffness accurately. Finally, the performance of the algorithm in the presence of noise is tested. We conclude that the new algorithm is a powerful new tool for the study of joint stiffness during functional tasks.},

Lateral balance is thought to require integrative sensorimotor control through adjustment of step width rather than length, contributing to greater variability in step width. Here we propose that step length variations are largely explained by the typical human preference for step length to increase with walking speed, which itself normally exhibits some slow and spontaneous fluctuation. In contrast, step width variations should have little relation to speed if they are produced more for lateral balance. As a test, we examined hundreds of overground walking steps by healthy young adults (N = 14, age $<$ 40 yrs.). We found that slow fluctuations in self-selected walking speed (2.3\% coefficient of variation) could explain most of the variance in step length (59\%, P $<$ 0.01). The residual variability not explained by speed was small (1.5\% coefficient of variation), suggesting that step length is actually quite precise if not for the slow speed fluctuations. Step width varied over faster time scales and was independent of speed fluctuations, with variance 4.3 times greater than that for step length (P $<$ 0.01) after accounting for the speed effect. That difference was further magnified by walking with eyes closed, which appears detrimental to control of lateral balance. Humans appear to modulate fore-aft foot placement in precise accordance with slow fluctuations in walking speed, whereas the variability of lateral foot placement appears more closely related to balance. Step variability is separable in both direction and time scale into balance- and speed-related components. The separation of factors not related to balance may reveal which aspects of walking are most critical for the nervous system to control.},

  abstract = {The human in manual control of a dynamical system can use both feedback and feedforward control strategies and will select a strategy based on performance and required effort. Literature has shown that feedforward control is used during tracking tasks in response to predictable targets. The influence of an external disturbance signal on the utilization of a feedforward control strategy has never been investigated, however. We hypothesized that the human will use a combined feedforward and feedback control strategy whenever the predictable target signal is sufficiently strong, and a predominantly feedback strategy whenever the random disturbance signal is dominant. From the data of a human-in-the-loop experiment we conclude that feedforward control is used in all the considered experimental conditions, including those where the disturbance signal is dominant and feedforward control does not deliver a marked performance advantage.},

  abstract = {We measured variability of foot placement during gait to test whether lateral balance must be actively controlled against dynamic instability. The hypothesis was developed using a simple dynamical model that can walk down a slight incline with a periodic gait resembling that of humans. This gait is entirely passive except that it requires active control for a single unstable mode, confined mainly to lateral motion. An especially efficient means of controlling this instability is to adjust lateral foot placement. We hypothesized that similar active feedback control is performed by humans, with fore-aft dynamics stabilized either passively or by very low-level control. The model predicts that uncertainty within the active feedback loop should result in variability in foot placement that is larger laterally than fore-aft. In addition, loss of sensory information such as by closing the eyes should result in larger increases in lateral variability. The control model also predicts a slight coupling between step width and length. We tested 15 young normal human subjects and found that lateral variability was 79\% larger than fore-aft variability with eyes open, and a larger increase in lateral variability (53\% vs. 21\%) with eyes closed, consistent with the model's predictions. We also found that the coupling between lateral and fore-aft foot placements was consistent with a value of 0.13 predicted by the control model. Our results imply that humans may harness passive dynamic properties of the limbs in the sagittal plane, but must provide significant active control in order to stabilize lateral motion.},

The main contribution of this article to bicycle dynamics is the analysis of tyre and rider properties that influence bicycle stability. A system identification method is used to extract linear stability properties from time domain analysis. The weave and capsize eigenmodes of the bicycle-rider system are analysed. The effect of tyre properties is studied using the tyre's forces and torques that have been measured in several operating conditions. The main result is that extending simplified models with a realistic tyre model leads to a notable decrease in the weave stability and a stabilization of the capsize mode. This effect is mainly caused by the twisting torque. Different tyres and tyre inflation pressures have little effect on the bicycle's stability, in the case of riding straight at a constant forward speed. On the other hand, the tyre load does have a large effect on bicycle stability. The sensitivity study of rider properties shows that body stiffness and damping have a small effect on the weave and capsize mode, whereas arm stiffness destabilizes the capsize mode and arm damping destabilizes the weave mode.},

  abstract = {The real-time (RT) integration of the equations of motion describing complex mechanical systems requires the employment of proper integration schemes which must be able to handle the time integration at each time step in less than an a priori fixed sampling time interval. The linearly implicit Euler method has been successfully employed for the RT integration of large stiff differential algebraic systems of equations (DAEs) which typically arise from the complex mechanical systems of interest in practical applications. The current industry demand is to further increase the degree of complexity of multibody models employed in RT applications, pushing researchers to improve the efficiency of the currently available integration methods. In this paper, we investigate the improvements in the efficiency of the linearly implicit Euler method coming from the conversion of the equations of motion at each time step from a dependent to an independent coordinates' formulation. The automatic switching from dependent to independent coordinates is achieved exploiting the properties of the matrix R whose columns represent a basis of the null-space of the constraint Jacobian matrix. A non-iterative projection method is also applied in order to avoid the drift-off from the constraint conditions.},

  doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0031767},
  abstract = {The control architecture underlying human reaching has been established, at least in broad outline. However, despite extensive research, the control architecture underlying human locomotion remains unclear. Some studies show evidence of high-level control focused on lower-limb trajectories; others suggest that nonlinear oscillators such as lower-level rhythmic central pattern generators (CPGs) play a significant role. To resolve this ambiguity, we reasoned that if a nonlinear oscillator contributes to locomotor control, human walking should exhibit dynamic entrainment to periodic mechanical perturbation; entrainment is a distinctive behavior of nonlinear oscillators. Here we present the first behavioral evidence that nonlinear neuro-mechanical oscillators contribute to the production of human walking, albeit weakly. As unimpaired human subjects walked at constant speed, we applied periodic torque pulses to the ankle at periods different from their preferred cadence. The gait period of 18 out of 19 subjects entrained to this mechanical perturbation, converging to match that of the perturbation. Significantly, entrainment occurred only if the perturbation period was close to subjects' preferred walking cadence: it exhibited a narrow basin of entrainment. Further, regardless of the phase within the walking cycle at which perturbation was initiated, subjects' gait synchronized or phase-locked with the mechanical perturbation at a phase of gait where it assisted propulsion. These results were affected neither by auditory feedback nor by a distractor task. However, the convergence to phase-locking was slow. These characteristics indicate that nonlinear neuro-mechanical oscillators make at most a modest contribution to human walking. Our results suggest that human locomotor control is not organized as in reaching to meet a predominantly kinematic specification, but is hierarchically organized with a semi-autonomous peripheral oscillator operating under episodic supervisory control.},

While cycling in a safe laboratory set-up, controlled lateral perturbations are applied to the rear of the bicycle. Three possible strategies to keep balance are analysed for a young and older aged group: steering, lateral trunk movement and outward knee movement. Older subjects appear to rely more on knee movement as a control mechanism than young subjects. Furthermore, the frequency domain analysis revealed that the older adults need more effort to counteract high frequency perturbations. Increased inter-individual variation for the older adults subject group suggests that this group can be seen as a transition group in terms of physical fitness. This explains their increased risk in single-sided bicycle accidents (i.e. accidents involving the cyclist only). Therefore, older cyclists could benefit from improving the stability of cycling at lower speeds.},

  abstract = {Objective : To determine if health outcomes and demographics differ according to helmet status between persons with cycling-related traumatic brain injuries (TBI). Methods : This is a retrospective study of 128 patients admitted to the Montreal General Hospital following a TBI that occurred while cycling from 2007-2011. Information was collected from the Quebec trauma registry and the coroner's office in cases of death from cycling accidents. The independent variables collected were socio-demographic, helmet status, clinical and neurological patient information. The dependent variables evaluated were length of stay (LOS), extended Glasgow outcome scale (GOS-E), injury severity scale (ISS), discharge destination and death. Results: 25\% of cyclists wore a helmet. The helmet group was older, more likely to be university educated, married and retired. Unemployment, longer intensive care unit (ICU) stay, severe intracranial bleeding and neurosurgical interventions were more common in the no helmet group. There was no significant association between the severity of the TBI, ISS scores, GOS-E or death and helmet wearing. The median age of the subjects who died was higher than those who survived. Conclusion : Cyclists without helmets were younger, less educated, single and unemployed. They had more severe TBIs on imaging, longer LOS in ICU and more neurosurgical interventions. Elderly cyclists admitted to the hospital appear to be at higher risk of dying in the event of a TBI.

A professional Olympic-level skier performed the skating technique without poles in a ski tunnel under controlled conditions and on an incline plane. Then, with the use of a force acquisition system attached to the ski bindings and a motion capture system set on site, the leg resultant forces and the movement of specific points of the skier's lower body were acquired. The data obtained from the motion capture system was used as the prescribed kinematic input data in the multibody model and the measured force was used later as a comparison parameter with the results of the simple model. After simulating the technique, the calculated propulsion forces seem to be in agreement with those measured in the field.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.ssci.2016.01.010},
  abstract = {In the Netherlands, each year 12,000 older cyclists require medical attention due to a single-bicycle accident where no other party is directly involved. Most of these accidents occur at low cycling velocities and 20\% occur during (dis)mounting the bicycle. Little is known about the strategies and corresponding kinematics of (dis)mounting. This study aims to classify (dis)mounting strategies of young and older cyclists and assess corresponding kinematics.

Thirteen young (18\textendash{}40 years) and 33 older (65\textendash{}90 years) cyclists, 13 with and 20 without a bi-cycle fall-history, participated. They were asked to mount the bicycle, cycle normally, stop and wait, continue cycling and dismount the bicycle at a certain point. Bicycle and cyclist motions were recorded with 10 Inertial Measurement Units and 2 video cameras. Kinematic parameters during the (dis)mounting period were assessed. First, a qualitative analysis of the different methods of (dis)mounting and `waiting' was made from the videos. Second, a quantitative assessment of the relationships between age, fall-history, gender and the kinematic parameters during (dis)mounting and waiting were studied.

We identified 2 mounting, 3 dismounting and 2 waiting categories, which each consisted of 2 or 3 sub-types based on timing to get on or off saddle and swing leg through frame or over saddle. The categories can mainly be distinguished by the first foot that is lifted on or off the pedal. Older cyclists and females prefer other strategies compared to young cyclists and males, respectively. E.g. during mounting, 70\% of the young cyclists lift their inside foot, the foot closest to the bicycle, and place it on the pedal, while 80\% of the older cyclists lift their outside foot and put it on the pedal and start pushing off with their inside foot from the ground one or more times. Furthermore, bicycle and cyclist kinematics could be related to age, fall-history and gender. Higher thigh angular velocities and accelerations (around mediolateral axis) were found for older cyclists and females compared to young cyclists and males, respectively. These differences, among others, may explain the high injury risk for older cyclists and females in single-bicycle accidents.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.coldregions.2016.02.005},
  abstract = {Bicycling is considered an attractive way of traveling and is becoming a more and more common mode of transportation in Scandinavia. However, winter conditions create a challenge for providing a high quality, functional bicycle road network. Winter maintenance actions, such as snow removal, gritting and salting, are needed. The Norwegian Public Road Administration (NPRA) sets standards for winter maintenance of cycleways, which includes a friction criterion. Friction measurement devices (FMDs) are used to test whether the conditions are within the specified standard. However, it is not known how well these values describe the friction experienced by bicycles. The two objectives of this study are: 1) to measure actual braking friction of bicycles in winter conditions and 2) to compare the results to friction measurement devices (FMDs). Two methods were used to measure bicycle friction in this study: deceleration and braking distance. Two instrumented bicycles with studded winter tires were tested by all-out braking tests on winter road surfaces. As a comparison, friction of the test stretch was measured by three FMDs. The results showed that both methods are suitable for defining bicycle friction; however, the deceleration was found to be a more accurate method in the given field conditions. The bicycles experienced the same or higher friction than the FMDs. The variability of bicycle friction was also greater than the variability of each individual FMD. This is probably due to lack of slip control of the bicycles and therefore it is uncertain whether maximum friction was in fact attained during the braking tests.},

  abstract = {Humans have ridden bicycles for over 200 years, yet there are no continuous measures of how skill differs between novice and expert. To address this knowledge gap, we measured the dynamics of human bicycle riding in 14 subjects, half of whom were skilled and half were novice. Each subject rode an instrumented bicycle on training rollers at speeds ranging from 1 to 7 m/s. Steer angle and rate, steer torque, bicycle speed, and bicycle roll angle and rate were measured and steering power calculated. A force platform beneath the roller assembly measured the net force and moment that the bicycle, rider and rollers exerted on the floor, enabling calculations of the lateral positions of the system centers of mass and pressure. Balance performance was quantified by cross-correlating the lateral positions of the centers of mass and pressure. The results show that all riders exhibited similar balance performance at the slowest speed. However at higher speeds, the skilled riders achieved superior balance performance by employing more rider lean control (quantified by cross-correlating rider lean angle and bicycle roll angle) and less steer control (quantified by cross-correlating steer rate and bicycle roll rate) than did novice riders. Skilled riders also used smaller steering control input with less variation (measured by average positive steering power and standard deviations of steer angle and rate) and less rider lean angle variation (measured by the standard deviation of the rider lean angle) independent of speed. We conclude that the reduction in balance control input by skilled riders is not due to reduced balance demands but rather to more effective use of lean control to guide the center of mass via center of pressure movements.},

Given the importance of legged locomotion to the survival of terrestrial mammals, and the relatively high energetic investment needed to provide for locomotion, it seems reasonable to expect that numerous important, potentially even crucial, adaptations have taken place in every species (or lineage) where locomotion has an important impact on survival and/or reproductive potential. In terrestrial locomotion, the phenomenon of locomotion is dominated by the interaction of the mass of the organism with the mass of the substrate. Almost all interpretation of such work will depend on a solid conceptual understanding of the factors that primarily influence locomotion strategies.},

We compute Bayes factors\textemdash{}a quantity that can be used to express comparative evidence for an hypothesis but also for the null hypothesis\textemdash{}for a large subset ( N  = 72) of the original papers and their corresponding replication attempts. In our computation, we take into account the likely scenario that publication bias had distorted the originally published results. Overall, 75\% of studies gave qualitatively similar results in terms of the amount of evidence provided. However, the evidence was often weak (i.e., Bayes factor \&lt; 10). The majority of the studies (64\%) did not provide strong evidence for either the null or the alternative hypothesis in either the original or the replication, and no replication attempts provided strong evidence in favor of the null. In all cases where the original paper provided strong evidence but the replication did not (15\%), the sample size in the replication was smaller than the original. Where the replication provided strong evidence but the original did not (10\%), the replication sample size was larger. We conclude that the apparent failure of the Reproducibility Project to replicate many target effects can be adequately explained by overestimation of effect sizes (or overestimation of evidence against the null hypothesis) due to small sample sizes and publication bias in the psychological literature. We further conclude that traditional sample sizes are insufficient and that a more widespread adoption of Bayesian methods is desirable.},

  title = {Automated {{Discovery}} and {{Learning}} of {{Complex Movement Behaviors}}},
  abstract = {In order to create useful physical robots, tell narratives in animated films and interactive games, or understand the underlying principles behind human movement, it is necessary to synthesize movement behaviors with the same wide variety, richness and complexity observed in humans and other animals. Moreover, these behaviors should be discovered automatically from only a few core principles, and not be a result of extensive manual engineering or merely a mimicking of demonstrations. In this thesis, I develop novel optimal control methods and apply large-scale neural network training to synthesize movement trajectories and interactive controllers that give rise to a range of behaviors such getting up from the ground, climbing, moving heavy objects, hand manipulation, acrobatics, and various cooperative actions involving multiple characters and their manipulation of the environment. Coupled with detailed models of human physiology, motions that match various kinematic and dynamic aspects of real human motion can be produced de novo, giving the predictive power to conduct virtual biomechanics experiments. The resulting movements are also used to successfully control a physical bipedal robot. The approach is fully automatic and does not require domain knowledge specific to each behavior, pre-existing examples or motion capture data. Although discovery and learning are computationally-expensive and rely on cloud and GPU computing, the interactive animation can run in real-time on any hardware once the controllers are learned.},

  abstract = {One of the main obstacles that prevents practical applications of antiferromagnets is the difficulty of manipulating the magnetic order parameter. Recently, following the theoretical prediction [J. $\backslash$v\{Z\}elezn$\backslash$'y et al., PRL 113, 157201 (2014)], the electrical switching of magnetic moments in an antiferromagnet has been demonstrated [P. Wadley et al., Science 351, 587 (2016)]. The switching is due to the so-called spin-orbit torque, which has been extensively studied in ferromagnets. In this phenomena a non-equilibrium spin-polarization exchange coupled to the ordered local moments is induced by current, hence exerting a torque on the order parameter. Here we give a general systematic analysis of the symmetry of the spin-orbit torque in locally and globally non-centrosymmetric crystals. We study when the symmetry allows for a nonzero torque, when is the torque effective, and its dependence on the applied current direction and orientation of magnetic moments. For comparison, we consider both antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic orders. In two representative model crystals we perform microscopic calculations of the spin-orbit torque to illustrate its symmetry properties and to highlight conditions under which the spin-orbit torque can be efficient for manipulating antiferromagnetic moments.},

  abstract = {The hypothesis of a Hierarchy of the Sciences with physical sciences at the top, social sciences at the bottom, and biological sciences in-between is nearly 200 years old. This order is intuitive and reflected in many features of academic life, but whether it reflects the ``hardness'' of scientific research\textemdash{}i.e., the extent to which research questions and results are determined by data and theories as opposed to non-cognitive factors\textemdash{}is controversial. This study analysed 2434 papers published in all disciplines and that declared to have tested a hypothesis. It was determined how many papers reported a ``positive'' (full or partial) or ``negative'' support for the tested hypothesis. If the hierarchy hypothesis is correct, then researchers in ``softer'' sciences should have fewer constraints to their conscious and unconscious biases, and therefore report more positive outcomes. Results confirmed the predictions at all levels considered: discipline, domain and methodology broadly defined. Controlling for observed differences between pure and applied disciplines, and between papers testing one or several hypotheses, the odds of reporting a positive result were around 5 times higher among papers in the disciplines of Psychology and Psychiatry and Economics and Business compared to Space Science, 2.3 times higher in the domain of social sciences compared to the physical sciences, and 3.4 times higher in studies applying behavioural and social methodologies on people compared to physical and chemical studies on non-biological material. In all comparisons, biological studies had intermediate values. These results suggest that the nature of hypotheses tested and the logical and methodological rigour employed to test them vary systematically across disciplines and fields, depending on the complexity of the subject matter and possibly other factors (e.g., a field's level of historical and/or intellectual development). On the other hand, these results support the scientific status of the social sciences against claims that they are completely subjective, by showing that, when they adopt a scientific approach to discovery, they differ from the natural sciences only by a matter of degree.},

The mathematical descriptions of these functions are extremely concise, but their implementation in real code is tedious, especially when optimized for real-time performance in interactive applications. We propose a new language, Opt (available under http://optlang.org), in which a user simply writes energy functions over image- or graph-structured unknowns, and a compiler automatically generates state-of-the-art GPU optimization kernels. The end result is a system in which real-world energy functions in graphics and vision applications are expressible in tens of lines of code. They compile directly into highly-optimized GPU solver implementations with performance competitive with the best published hand-tuned, application-specific GPU solvers, and 1-2 orders of magnitude beyond a general-purpose auto-generated solver.},

We present tests of individual components including time-integration and advection schemes, non-orthogonal coordinate systems and the shifted metric procedure which is used to handle highly sheared grids. The Flux Coordinate Independent (FCI) approach to differencing along magnetic field-lines has been implemented in BOUT++, and is here verified using the MMS in a sheared slab configuration.

It is shown that the fast-wave slow-wave SDC (FWSW-SDC) iteration will converge for small enough time steps and that in the limit of infinitely fast waves the convergence rate of the non-split version is retained. Stability function and discrete dispersion relation are derived and show that the method is stable for essentially arbitrary fast-wave CFL numbers as long as the slow dynamics are resolved. The method causes little numerical diffusion and its semi-discrete phase speed is accurate also for large wave number modes. Performance is studied for an acoustic-advection problem and for the linearised Boussinesq equations, describing compressible, stratified flow. FWSW-SDC is compared to a diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta (DIRK) and IMEX Runge-Kutta (IMEX) method and found to be competitive in terms of both accuracy and cost.},

The hypothesis was that because visual information specifies the position of the body in space, it would couple preferentially into those combinations of degrees of freedom (DOFs) that move the body in space and not into combinations of DOFs that do not move the body in space. Subjects stood quietly in a virtual reality cave for 4-min trials with or without a 0.2, 2.0 Hz, or combined 0.2 and 2.0 Hz visual field perturba-tion that was below perceptual threshold. Motion analysis was used to compute six sagittal plane joint angles. Vari-ance across time of the angular motion was partitioned into (1) variance associated with motion of the body and (2)},

The platform is based on popular open source hardware and software like Arduino and Raspberry Pi using well known languages and libraries. Some experimental results about the throughput of the overall system are reported showing the feasibility of acquiring data from up to 6 sensors with a sampling frequency no less than 118 Hz.},

  abstract = {Good design is not free of form. It does not necessarily happen through a mere sampling of technologies packaged together, through pure analysis, or just by following procedures. Good design begins with inspiration and a vision, a mental image of the end product, which can sometimes be described with a design metaphor. A successful example from the 20th century is the desktop metaphor, which took a real desktop as an orientation for the manipulation of electronic documents on a computer. Initially defined by Xerox, then refined by Apple and others, it could be found on almost every computer by the turn of the 20th century. This paper sketches a specific metaphor for the emerging field of highly automated vehicles, their interactions with human users and with other vehicles. In the introduction, general questions on vehicle automation are raised and related to the physical control of conventional vehicles and to the automation of some late 20th century vehicles. After some words on design metaphors, the H-Metaphor is introduced. More details of the metaphor's source are described and their application to human-machine interaction, automation and management of intelligent vehicles sketched. Finally, risks and opportunities to apply the metaphor to technical applications are discussed.},

Complex equations are automatically manipulated, optimized, and translated into highly optimized C code that aims to perform compa- rably or better than hand-tuned code.

  abstract = {The study investigates immediate adaptations of gait and balance to a single session of perturbed treadmill walking in patients with Parkinson's disease. 39 Parkinson's patients in stage 1\textendash{}3.5 of the Hoehn and Yahr Scale were randomized into one of two groups, stratified by disease severity: The experimental group (n = 19) walked on a treadmill prototype which constantly applied perturbation by small three-dimensional tilting movements of the walking surface. The control group (n = 20) trained on the identical treadmill without perturbations. Patients walked on the treadmill for 20 min. Primary outcome measure was overground walking speed. Secondary outcomes were postural sway during quiet standing and spatiotemporal gait parameters during treadmill walking. Outcomes were measured repeatedly throughout the training session and after 10 min retention. The experimental group significantly increased overground walking speed after intervention compared to the control group (p = 0.014; ES = +0.41). Gait variability during treadmill walking significantly decreased after walking with perturbation. Sway area increased with treadmill walking only in the control group (p = 0.009; ES = +0.49). No other postural sway measures changed over time. Subgroup analyses revealed that in the experimental group patients with more pronounced motor impairment demonstrated larger increases in overground walking speed (p = 0.016; ES = +0.40) and stance phase symmetry (p = 0.011; ES = -0.42). In conclusion, a single session of perturbation treadmill training led to gait improvements, which were more pronounced compared to unperturbed treadmill walking. Effects on static postural sway were less pronounced.},

  doi = {10.1109/TBME.2016.2586891},
  abstract = {Objective: Musculoskeletal models provide a noninvasive means to study human movement and predict the effects of interventions on gait. Our goal was to create an open-source, three-dimensional musculoskeletal model with high-fidelity representations of the lower limb musculature of healthy young individuals that can be used to generate accurate simulations of gait. Methods: Our model includes bony geometry for the full body, 37 degrees of freedom to define joint kinematics, Hill-type models of 80 muscle-tendon units actuating the lower limbs, and 17 ideal torque actuators driving the upper body. The model's musculotendon parameters are derived from previous anatomical measurements of 21 cadaver specimens and magnetic resonance images of 24 young healthy subjects. We tested the model by evaluating its computational time and accuracy of simulations of healthy walking and running. Results: Generating muscle-driven simulations of normal walking and running took approximately 10 minutes on a typical desktop computer. The differences between our muscle-generated and inverse dynamics joint moments were within 3\% (RMSE) of the peak inverse dynamics joint moments in both walking and running, and our simulated muscle activity showed qualitative agreement with salient features from experimental electromyography data. Conclusion: These results suggest that our model is suitable for generating muscle-driven simulations of healthy gait. We encourage other researchers to further validate and apply the model to study other motions of the lower-extremity. Significance: The model is implemented in the open source software platform OpenSim. The model and data used to create and test the simulations are freely available at https://simtk.org/home/full\_body/, allowing others to reproduce these results and create their own simulations.},

  abstract = {For simulating driving maneuvers with single track vehicles like motorcycles a driver model is needed. This is due to the fact that single track vehicles are inherently instable systems which tend to capsize if the system state is not considered properly. This paper demonstrates the development of a driver model for vehicle dynamic simulations by use of a co-simulation environment. The information needed for control design are directly obtained from a multi body model using the mbs software Simpack. The driver model is modeled in Simulink and consists of a state-space controller for stabilization and roll angle control, a path following controller which calculates the target roll angle and a velocity controller. The simulation is carried out by connecting the mbs-vehicle model with the driver model by use of a co-simulation interface.},

  title = {Modelling the Control Strategies for Riding a Motorcycle},
  abstract = {Computer simulation models are increasingly necessary as a design tool for modern vehicles, for which a subcategory relates to motorcycles. Simulation models can be employed for a variety of applications, an important area of which relates to the motorcycle's dynamic responses. The response of a motorcycle is heavily dependent on the rider's control actions, and consequently a means of replicating the rider's actions provides an important extension to this area.

The application of mathematical control techniques for replicating the motorcycle rider's control actions is presented in this thesis, detailing specifically the techniques of optimal control and model predictive control. The work begins with modelling the dynamics of the motorcycle using standard procedures. The application of optimal control to a motorcycle rider is not new, but the available results have been extended significantly over those previously available, allowing further insights into the behaviour and therefore applicability of this strategy to modelling a motorcycle rider. Use of the model predictive control approach is new in the field of motorcycle rider modelling, and a similarly extensive parametric study is conducted to evaluate the suitability of this approach, and to highlight the similarities and differences between this and the optimal control approach.

Both controller models were simulated over a standard single lane-change manoeuvre. Comparison of the relative performances of the two control approaches confirmed strong similarities between the techniques, particularly when the modelled rider is permitted an extensive knowledge of the approaching road path to follow. When this knowledge is restricted, differences were apparent between the two, suggesting the predictive control approach is capable of better performance here, and therefore represents a more robust control strategy. An option of the predictive control approach allows more elaborate target paths for the rider to follow to be set. However, defining the target path for the rider model to follow as the road centreline, and then permitting the controller itself to select the most appropriate course to take, has also been shown to be the more suitable option.

The predictive control technique for motorcycle rider modelling is shown to be a theoretically suitable application. Further work is suggested to validate the results presented here. If it can be confirmed that the model accurately captures a motorcycle rider's actions, this will prove a very useful tool for the understanding of a motorcycle rider's control actions, with potential benefits towards rider safety and furthermore as a design tool for the motorcycle industry.},

Nature of problem:

We have developed algorithms [5] for numerical solution of Hamilton's equations. (1) q \. a = $\partial$ H ( q , p ) / $\partial$ p a a , p \. a = - $\partial$ H ( q , p ) / $\partial$ q a , a = 1 \ldots{} N for Hamiltonians of the form (2) H ( q , p ) = T ( p ) + V ( q ) = ( 1 / 2 ) p T M p + V ( q ) , with M a symmetric positive definite matrix. The algorithms preserve the symplectic property of the time evolution exactly, and are of orders $\tau$ N (for 2 $\leq$ N $\leq$ 8 ) in the timestep $\tau$ . Although explicit, the algorithms are time-consuming and error-prone to implement numerically by hand, in particular for larger N .

Solution method:

We use computer algebra to perform all analytic calculations required for a specific model, and to generate the Python code for numerical solution of this model, including example programs using that code.

Restrictions:

In our implementation the mass matrix is assumed to be equal to the unit matrix, and V ( q ) must be sufficiently differentiable.

Running time:

Subseconds to eons (problem dependent). See discussion in the main article.

  shorttitle = {{{OpenRAVE}}},
  abstract = {One of the challenges in developing real-world autonomous robots is the need for integrating and rigorously testing high-level scripting, motion planning, perception, and control algorithms. For this purpose, we introduce an open-source cross-platform software architecture called OpenRAVE, the Open Robotics and Animation Virtual Environment. OpenRAVE is targeted for real-world autonomous robot applications, and includes a seamless integration of 3-D simulation, visualization, planning, scripting and control. A plugin architecture allows users to easily write custom controllers or extend functionality. With OpenRAVE plugins, any planning algorithm, robot controller, or sensing subsystem can be distributed and dynamically loaded at run-time, which frees developers from struggling with monolithic code-bases. Users of OpenRAVE can concentrate on the development of planning and scripting aspects of a problem without having to explicitly manage the details of robot kinematics and dynamics, collision detection, world updates, and robot control. The OpenRAVE architecture provides a flexible interface that can be used in conjunction with other popular robotics packages such as Player and ROS because it is focused on autonomous motion planning and high-level scripting rather than low-level control and message protocols. OpenRAVE also supports a powerful network scripting environment which makes it simple to control and monitor robots and change execution flow during run-time. One of the key advantages of open component architectures is that they enable the robotics research community to easily share and compare algorithms.},

These applications deal with complex human and environment interactions, requiring advanced modeling and control techniques to boost performance. The identification of robot dynamics, which include the dynamic parameters, is a key issue for model-based controllers, having also a key role in realistic robot simulation. The dynamic parameters are constants related to robot link inertias, joint frictions, and other dynamic aspects. In order to identify the dynamic parameters, regression methods based on recorded position and force based data are usually the only viable option. However, there is a problem which often appears in the regression of dynamic parameters: it is the so-called physical feasibility issue. Robot dynamic parameters have physical meaning, they represent physical quantities, and thereby the parameter estimations must correspond to physically feasible values. If the parameters are not feasible, i.e., not consistent from the physical point of view, then they will render an unrealistic and unstable dynamic model. A simple example of a not physically feasible parameter is a mass with negative value: its use in simulation or in a model-based controller entails positive feedback and divergent behavior. It is straightforward to verify whether a complete set of standard dynamic parameters comply with the physical feasibility conditions. Nevertheless, when identifying dynamic parameters though regression, it is only possible to identify linear combinations of parameters, the so-called base parameters. Moreover, the direct feasibility verification method for the standard parameters is not applicable to the base parameters. Although physically infeasible estimations are intrinsically unstable, there are cases where they are so close to the feasible region that the effects can remain hidden until the robot preforms a unusual motion, hence presenting potentially danger situations. An effective and efficient method for base parameter feasibility test had yet not been devised, hence posing an open problem. This thesis presents a novel approach that describes the physical feasibility conditions as a linear matrix inequality (LMI). This approach enables easy representation of the feasible region either using the standard or the base parameter space. With this representation it is possible to devise methods for feasibility test and correction, rooted in recent mathematical formulations and tools related to semidefinite programming (SDP). Furthermore, a novel method which finds the optimal feasible parameter solution that best fits a given regression data set is also presented. These methods are experimentally tested in the real case of the parameter identification of a WAM robot, a seven-link manipulator widely used in applications that require both motion and contact. The manipulator model is devised from software tools developed within this work, which also implement feasibility methods. The software stack is available for free and is completely open, relying only on open-source languages and libraries. Experimental validation has shown to be effective, and the physically feasible parameter identification of the 7-link WAM robot is absolutely necessary when tested in simulation and model-based control applications. This novel approach is compared with previous works addressing feasibility issues. Although previous works solve some parts of the problem, all of them present several drawbacks when compared to the methods presented here. The approach based on linear matrix inequalities and semidefinite programming addresses the problem from a sound and elegant mathematical perspective. The methods provide optimal solutions and are very efficient, even when the problem size scales.},

  abstract = {The Python programming language is becoming increasingly popular for scientific applications due to its simplicity, versatility, and the broad range of its libraries. A drawback of this dynamic language, however, is its low runtime performance which limits its applicability for large simulations and for the analysis of large data sets, as is common in astrophysics and cosmology. While various frameworks have been developed to address this limitation, most focus on covering the complete language set, and either force the user to alter the code or are not able to reach the full speed of an optimised native compiled language. In order to combine the ease of Python and the speed of C++, we developed HOPE, a specialised Python just-in-time (JIT) compiler designed for numerical astrophysical applications. HOPE focuses on a subset of the language and is able to translate Python code into C++ while performing numerical optimisation on mathematical expressions at runtime. To enable the JIT compilation, the user only needs to add a decorator to the function definition. We assess the performance of HOPE by performing a series of benchmarks and compare its execution speed with that of plain Python, C++ and the other existing frameworks. We find that HOPE improves the performance compared to plain Python by a factor of 2 to 120, achieves speeds comparable to that of C++, and often exceeds the speed of the existing solutions. We discuss the differences between HOPE and the other frameworks, as well as future extensions of its capabilities. The fully documented HOPE package is available at http://hope.phys.ethz.ch and is published under the GPLv3 license on PyPI and GitHub.},

  abstract = {Despite their recognized limitations, bibliometric assessments of scientific productivity have been widely adopted. We describe here an improved method that makes novel use of the co-citation network of each article to field-normalize the number of citations it has received. The resulting Relative Citation Ratio is article-level and field-independent, and provides an alternative to the invalid practice of using Journal Impact Factors to identify influential papers. To illustrate one application of our method, we analyzed 88,835 articles published between 2003 and 2010, and found that the National Institutes of Health awardees who authored those papers occupy relatively stable positions of influence across all disciplines. We demonstrate that the values generated by this method strongly correlate with the opinions of subject matter experts in biomedical research, and suggest that the same approach should be generally applicable to articles published in all areas of science. A beta version of iCite, our web tool for calculating Relative Citation Ratios of articles listed in PubMed, is available at https://icite.od.nih.gov .},

  abstract = {This paper illustrates and discusses the main features of the motorcycle riding simulator designed and built at the University of Padua over recent years. The simulator has been developed for a variety of purposes: to develop and test electronic devices aimed at improving rider safety and vehicle performance (antilock braking systems, traction control systems, etc.), to investigate different design choices and parameter effects on vehicle dynamics, to train riders, and to study their behaviours in different scenarios (normal riding, dangerous situations, etc.).
Within the simulator the rider sits on a motorcycle mock-up provided with all the inputs available on a real motorcycle (throttle, clutch, brakes, etc.). These controls are used as inputs for an advanced virtual motorcycle model which computes the real-time vehicle dynamics. With the aim of giving the rider a proper motion cue, a washout filter converts the motion of the virtual motorcycle into the proper motion of a five-degrees-of-freedom motorcycle mock-up. Finally the audiovisual cues are delivered with a 180$^\circ$ panel and 5.1 surround sound system.
To validate the simulator, a specific protocol which includes both an objective evaluation and a subjective evaluation was designed and carried out.
External devices such as advanced rider assistant systems, on-bike information systems, and human\textendash{}machine interfaces can be easily integrated into the simulator by means of a standard controller area network.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to the assessment of the manoeuvrability of vehicles which is not based on the simulation of open-loop manoeuvres, nor does it rely on the modelling of the driver as a control system. Instead, the essence of the method is the solution of a two-point optimal control boundary value problem, in which a vehicle, subject to physical constraints like tyre adherence and road borders, among others, is required to go between given initial and final positions as fast as possible. The control inputs - i.e., the driver's actions - that make the vehicle move between the two states in the most efficient way are found as a part of the solution procedure and represent the actions of a sort of ideal, perfect driver. The resulting motion is called the optimal manoeuvre and, besides being the most efficient way that the given vehicle has for travelling between the two points according to the chosen optimal criterion, may be taken as a reference for meaningful comparisons with other vehicles. The value of the penalty function, used to define the optimal condition occurring at the optimal manoeuvre, may be taken as a measure of manoeuvrability or handling. With this approach the manoeuvrability properties are established as intrinsic to the vehicle, being defined with respect to an ideal perfect driver. Some possible forms of the penalty function, which means slightly different concepts of manoeuvrability and handling, are discussed. In the end, the case of motorcycles and some examples of optimal manoeuvres are given.},

Given a linear parametrized bicycle vehicle model, a simple manual controller, and a model-based metric that correlates with subjective handling measures, we formulate the search for optimal geometric parameters that give the best handling bicycle. Optimal bicycle designs for a number of design speeds are discovered including bicycles with unintuitive geometry, such as large negative trail. The resulting maximum handling quality metrics for the optimal bicycle designs follow a logarithmic relationship with respect to design speed. These optimal handling bicycles can be ridden at speeds other than the design speed and, in general, handling difficulty decreases with increasing speed. Finally, we show that there is little evidence of correlation between bicycle open-loop stability and optimal handling.},

  doi = {10.1115/1.4033311},
  abstract = {The problem of maneuvering a vehicle through a race course in minimum time requires computation of both longitudinal (brake and throttle) and lateral (steering wheel) control inputs. Unfortunately, solving the resulting nonlinear optimal control problem is typically computationally expensive and infeasible for real-time trajectory planning. This paper presents an iterative algorithm that divides the path generation task into two sequential subproblems that are significantly easier to solve. Given an initial path through the race track, the algorithm runs a forward\textendash{}backward integration scheme to determine the minimum-time longitudinal speed profile, subject to tire friction constraints. With this fixed speed profile, the algorithm updates the vehicle's path by solving a convex optimization problem that minimizes the resulting path curvature while staying within track boundaries and obeying affine, time-varying vehicle dynamics constraints. This two-step process is repeated iteratively until the predicted lap time no longer improves. While providing no guarantees of convergence or a globally optimal solution, the approach performs very well when validated on the Thunderhill Raceway course in Willows, CA. The predicted lap time converges after four to five iterations, with each iteration over the full 4.5\,km race course requiring only 30 s of computation time on a laptop computer. The resulting trajectory is experimentally driven at the race circuit with an autonomous Audi TTS test vehicle, and the resulting lap time and racing line are comparable to both a nonlinear gradient descent solution and a trajectory recorded from a professional racecar driver. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method is a viable option for online trajectory planning in the near future.},

The naive use of increasingly more processors for a fixed-size N-body problem is prone to saturate as soon as the number of unknowns per core becomes too small. To overcome this intrinsic strong-scaling limit, we introduce temporal parallelism on top of pepc's existing hybrid MPI/PThreads spatial decomposition. Here, we use pfasst which is based on a combination of the iterations of the parallel-in-time algorithm parareal with the sweeps of spectral deferred correction (SDC) schemes. By combining these sweeps with multiple space-time discretization levels, pfasst relaxes the theoretical bound on parallel efficiency in parareal. We present results from runs on up to 262,144 cores on the IBM Blue Gene/P installation JUGENE, demonstrating that the space-time parallel code provides speedup beyond the saturation of the purely space-parallel approach.},

With regard to motorcycle manoeuvrability, a notable example of such a measure, or metric, is the Koch index [Koch, J., 1978, Experimentelle und Analytische Untersuchungen des Motorraad-Fahrer Systems. Dissertation, Berlin.]. This article describes the development of a new metric applied to lane change (LC) tests and coined `LC roll index'. This metric takes into account the peak-to-peak values of the rider-input steering torque divided by the peak-to-peak roll rate response of the vehicle and normalizes this quantity by the forward velocity. In addition to this new metric, an analytical expression is developed, which in many cases summarizes a motorcycle's LC performance in a single, terse, analytical term. Experimental results are presented for three vastly different motorcycles: a scooter, a street, and a touring motorcycle performing variations of the LC manoeuvre. Numerous test runs for each vehicle are analysed and the results are summarized along with those presented in the recent literature. Finally, simulation results are presented to highlight the correlation between the proposed indices and handling.},

Powered exoskeletons and other assistive devices are sophisticated modern tools that have restored bipedal locomotion in individuals with paraplegia and have endowed unimpaired individuals with superhuman strength. Despite these successes, designing assistive devices that reduce energy consumption during running remains a substantial challenge, in part because these devices disrupt the dynamics of a complex, finely tuned biological system. Furthermore, designers have hitherto relied primarily on experiments, which cannot report muscle-level energy consumption and are fraught with practical challenges. In this study, we use OpenSim to generate muscle-driven simulations of 10 human subjects running at 2 and 5 m/s. We then add ideal, massless assistive devices to our simulations and examine the predicted changes in muscle recruitment patterns and metabolic power consumption. Our simulations suggest that an assistive device should not necessarily apply the net joint moment generated by muscles during unassisted running, and an assistive device can reduce the activity of muscles that do not cross the assisted joint. Our results corroborate and suggest biomechanical explanations for similar effects observed by experimentalists, and can be used to form hypotheses for future experimental studies. The models, simulations, and software used in this study are freely available at simtk.org and can provide insight into assistive device design that complements experimental approaches.},

Overuse injuries have been intuitively linked to the anatomic structure of the foot because external loads are applied to the foot in cycling. Thus, the structure and function of the foot should dictate in part how the loads are transmitted to the knee joint. Therefore, it was hypothesized that patterns in knee loads are related to the anatomic structure of the foot. To test this hypothesis, peak knee loads (dependent variables) were related to anatomical variables (independent variables) through statistical analyses. This required first the detailed evaluation (i.e. measurement) of the anatomical structure of the foot and leg for 23 subjects. Next, three-dimensional knee joint loads were determined for a standardized riding condition. The results of the statistical analyses indicated that a group of cyclists with the most extreme inversion of the forefoot relative to the transverse plane developed significantly greater average posterior knee force and extensive knee moment. In addition, a number of anatomical variables significantly accounted for the variability in peak values of the posterior force, the extensive moment, the varus/valgus moment and the external axial moment. Based on these results, the hypothesis is accepted.},

Human input is taken to be a torque applied at the ankles. The equations of the nonholonomic rider-board system are presented and a simple tracking task is established. Its dynamics are augmented by those of the skateboard and rider to describe the complete system in the tracking mode. Several control schemes are discussed. Under certain conditions, simple proportional feedback control of rider tilt angle can stabilize roll motion of the vehicle, but in the most general case full state feedback is required. In the complete state feedback case, a performance index for the tracking task is defined and the minimizing feedback gains determined. Time simulations of the tracking task using the optimal feeback gains are shown. Experimental results are presented which tend to validate the theory.},

  title = {Rider Motion Identification during Normal Bicycling by Means of Principal Component Analysis},
  copyright = {Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC-BY)},
  abstract = {Recent observations of a bicyclist riding through town and on a treadmill show that the rider uses the upper body very little when performing normal maneuvers and that the bicyclist may in fact primarily use steering input for control. They also revealed that other motions such as lateral movement of the knees were used in low speed stabilization. In order to validate the hypothesis that there is little upper body motion during casual cycling, an in-depth motion capture analysis was performed on the bicycle and rider system. We used motion capture technology to record the motion of three similar young adult male riders riding two different city bicycles on a treadmill. Each rider rode each bicycle while performing stability trials at speeds ranging from 2 km/h to 30 km/h: stabilizing while pedaling normally, stabilizing without pedaling, line tracking while pedaling, and stabilizing with nohands. These tasks were chosen with the intent of examining differences in the kinematics at various speeds, the effects of pedaling on the system, upper body control motions and the differences in tracking and stabilization. Principal component analysis was used to transform the data into a manageable set organized by the variance associated with the principal components. In this paper, these principal components were used to characterize various distinct kinematic motions that occur during stabilization with and without pedaling. These motions were grouped on the basis of correlation and conclusions were drawn about which motions are candidates for stabilization related control actions.},

  abstract = {Explanations for women's underrepresentation in math-intensive fields of science often focus on sex discrimination in grant and manuscript reviewing, interviewing, and hiring. Claims that women scientists suffer discrimination in these arenas rest on a set of studies undergirding policies and programs aimed at remediation. More recent and robust empiricism, however, fails to support assertions of discrimination in these domains. To better understand women's underrepresentation in math-intensive fields and its causes, we reprise claims of discrimination and their evidentiary bases. Based on a review of the past 20 y of data, we suggest that some of these claims are no longer valid and, if uncritically accepted as current causes of women's lack of progress, can delay or prevent understanding of contemporary determinants of women's underrepresentation. We conclude that differential gendered outcomes in the real world result from differences in resources attributable to choices, whether free or constrained, and that such choices could be influenced and better informed through education if resources were so directed. Thus, the ongoing focus on sex discrimination in reviewing, interviewing, and hiring represents costly, misplaced effort: Society is engaged in the present in solving problems of the past, rather than in addressing meaningful limitations deterring women's participation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics careers today. Addressing today's causes of underrepresentation requires focusing on education and policy changes that will make institutions responsive to differing biological realities of the sexes. Finally, we suggest potential avenues of intervention to increase gender fairness that accord with current, as opposed to historical, findings.},

  abstract = {Humans perform a variety of feedback adjustments to maintain balance during walking. These include lateral footfall placement, and center of pressure adjustment under the stance foot, to stabilize lateral balance. A less appreciated possibility would be to steer for balance like a bicycle, whose front wheel may be turned toward the direction of a lean to capture the center of mass. Humans could potentially combine steering with other strategies to distribute balance adjustments across multiple degrees of freedom. We tested whether human balance can theoretically benefit from steering, and experimentally tested for evidence of steering for balance. We first developed a simple dynamic walking model, which shows that bipedal walking may indeed be stabilized through steering\textemdash{}externally rotating the foot about vertical toward the direction of lateral lean for each footfall\textemdash{}governed by linear feedback control. Moreover, least effort (mean-square control torque) is required if steering is combined with lateral foot placement. If humans use such control, footfall variability should show a statistical coupling between external rotation with lateral placement. We therefore examined the spontaneous fluctuations of hundreds of strides of normal overground walking in healthy adults (N=26). We found significant coupling ( P = 9 $\cdot$ 10 - 8 ), of 0.54 rad of external rotation per meter of lateral foot deviation. Successive footfalls showed a weaker, negative correlation with each other, similar to how a bicycle's steering adjustment made for balance must be followed by gradual corrections to resume the original travel direction. Steering may be one of multiple strategies to stabilize balance during walking.},

  doi = {10.1115/1.4035410},
  abstract = {Formulating the dynamics equations of a mechanical system following a multibody dynamics approach often leads to a set of highly nonlinear Differential Algebraic Equations (DAEs). While this form of the equations of motion is suitable for a wide range of practical applications, in some cases it is necessary to have access to the linearized system dynamics. This is the case when stability and modal analysis are to be carried out; the definition of plant and system models for certain control algorithms and state estimators also requires a linear expression of the dynamics. A number of methods for the linearization of multibody dynamics can be found in the literature. They differ in both the approach that they follow to handle the equations of motion and the way in which they deliver their results, which in turn are determined by the selection of the generalized coordinates used to describe the mechanical system. This selection is closely related to the way in which the kinematic constraints of the system are treated. Three major approaches can be distinguished and used to categorize most of the linearization methods published so far. In this work, we demonstrate the properties of each approach in the linearization of systems in static equilibrium, illustrating them with the study of two representative examples.},

The subject exhibited a bilateral work asymmetry of 83.5\% when cycling with his daily use prosthesis in a free-swing mode. When 60-N$\cdot$m peak assistance was provided by the powered prosthesis, the bilateral work asymmetry was reduced to 11.4\%. The subject's metabolic energy rate was measured for speed and power-matched cycling while the powered prosthesis provided zero assistance (i.e., turned OFF and providing its back-drive resistance) or 30-N$\cdot$m peak assistance.

  abstract = {Here we apply a control theoretic view of movement to the behavior of human locomotion with the goal of using perturbations to learn about subtask control. Controlling one's speed and maintaining upright posture are two critical subtasks, or underlying functions, of human locomotion. How the nervous system simultaneously controls these two subtasks was investigated in this study. Continuous visual and mechanical perturbations were applied concurrently to subjects (n=20) as probes to investigate these two subtasks during treadmill walking. Novel application of harmonic transfer function (HTF) analysis to human motor behavior was used, and these HTFs were converted to the time-domain based representation of phase-dependent impulse response functions ($\phi$IRFs). These $\phi$IRFs were used to identify the mapping from perturbation inputs to kinematic and electromyographic (EMG) outputs throughout the phases of the gait cycle. Mechanical perturbations caused an initial, passive change in trunk orientation and, at some phases of stimulus presentation, a corrective trunk EMG and orientation response. Visual perturbations elicited a trunk EMG response prior to a trunk orientation response, which was subsequently followed by an anterior-posterior displacement response. This finding supports the notion that there is a temporal hierarchy of functional subtasks during locomotion in which the control of upper-body posture precedes other subtasks. Moreover, the novel analysis we apply has the potential to probe a broad range of rhythmic behaviors to better understand their neural control.},

  abstract = {Simulating realistic musculoskeletal dynamics is critical to understanding neural control of muscle activity evoked in sensorimotor feedback responses that have inherent neural transmission delays. Thus, the initial mechanical response of muscles to perturbations in the absence of any change in muscle activity determines which corrective neural responses are required to stabilize body posture. Muscle short-range stiffness, a history-dependent property of muscle that causes a rapid and transient rise in muscle force upon stretch, likely affects musculoskeletal dynamics in the initial mechanical response to perturbations. Here we identified the contributions of short-range stiffness to joint torques and angles in the initial mechanical response to support surface translations using dynamic simulation, respectively. We developed a dynamic model of muscle short-range stiffness to augment a Hill-type muscle model. Our simulations show that short-range stiffness can provide stability against external perturbations during the neuromechanical response delay. Assuming constant muscle activation during the initial mechanical response, including muscle short-range stiffness was necessary to account for the rapid rise in experimental sagittal plane knee and hip joint torques that occurs simultaneously with very small changes in joint angles and reduced root mean square errors between simulated and experimental torques by 56\% and 47\%, respectively. Moreover, forward simulations lacking short-range stiffness produced unreasonably large joint angle changes during the initial response. Using muscle models accounting for short-range stiffness along with other aspects of history-dependent muscle dynamics may be important to advance our ability to simulate inherently unstable human movements based on principles of neural control and biomechanics.},

During five months, the IG used a bike desk for four class hours/week. Energy expenditure was measured during six consecutive days. Anthropometric parameters, aerobic fitness, academic performance, cognitive performance and brain functioning were assessed before (T0) and after (T1) the intervention.Results:Energy expenditure of the IG was significantly higher during the class hours in which they used the bike desks relative to normal class hours. The CG had a significantly higher BMI at T1 relative to T0 while this was not significantly different for the IG. Aerobic fitness was significantly better in the IG at T1 relative to T0. No significant effects on academic performance cognitive performance and brain functioning were observed.Conclusion:As the implementation of bike desks in the classroom did not interfere with adolescents' academic performance, this can be seen as an effective means of reducing in-class sedentary time and improving adolescents' physical health.},

  abstract = {Objective: To discuss the challenges in estimating bicycle helmet effectiveness from case-control studies of injured cyclists and to estimate helmet effectiveness from cases and available exposure data.Methods: Data were extracted from studies of cyclists in Seattle, USA, Victoria and New South Wales (NSW), Australia and the Netherlands. Estimates of helmet use were used as exposure to compute relative risks for Seattle and Victorian data. Cycling distance data are routinely collected in the Netherlands; however, this data cannot be disaggregated by helmet use which makes it unsuitable for estimating helmet effectiveness. Alternative controls were identified from larger cohorts for the Seattle and NSW cases.Results: Estimates of helmet effectiveness were similar from odds ratios using hospital controls or from relative risks using helmet use estimates (Seattle: OR = 0.339, RR = 0.444; Victoria: OR = 0.500, RR = 0.353). Additionally, the odds ratios using hospital controls were similar when controls were taken from a larger cohort for head injury of any severity (Seattle: OR = 0.250, alt OR = 0.257; NSW: OR = 0.411,alt OR = 0.446) and for serious head injury (Seattle: OR = 0.135, alt OR = 0.139; NSW: OR = 0.308, alt OR = 0.335). Although relevant exposure data were unavailable for the Netherlands, the odds ratio for helmet effectiveness of those using racing, mountain or hybrid bikes was similar to other estimates (OR = 0.371).Conclusions: Despite potential weaknesses with case-control study designs, the best available evidence suggests helmet use is an effective measure of reducing cycling head injury.},

  abstract = {This paper describes how a graduate mechanical engineering student was employed as a design coach on a senior undergraduate design team working on the development of a low-cost, low-volume plastic injection modeling machine. Traditional undergraduate design teams are formed with novice, inexperienced engineering students with limited training in project planning and management. By introducing a graduate engineering student who is formally trained in design methods and project management and who has experience in design practice, it was felt that the undergraduate students could focus more on the engineering design aspects of the project, similar to the work that they would experience upon graduation. For the graduate design coach, four roles were identified: design tool teacher, design reviewer, project manager, and, in this unique case, customer. A critique of the roles, including the time spent in each, is provided. This experience proved more satisfactory to both the students and the industry sponsoring customer than had been the case with similar projects.},

  abstract = {Individuals with lower limb amputation have a high fall risk, which could be partially due to a lack of stabilizing control in conventional prostheses. Inspired by walking robots, we hypothesized that modulating prosthetic ankle push-off could help improve amputee balance. We developed a three-dimensional walking model, found limit cycles at two speeds, and designed state-feedback controllers that made once-per-step adjustments to ankle push-off work, fore-aft and medial-lateral foot placement, and ankle roll resistance. To assess balance, we applied increasing levels of random changes in ground height and lateral impulses until the model fell down within 100 steps. Although foot placement is known to be important for balance, we found that push-off control was at least twice as effective at recovering from both disturbances at both speeds. Push-off work affected both fore-aft and mediolateral motions, leading to good controllability, and was particularly well suited to recovery from steps up or down. Our results suggest that discrete control of ankle push-off may be more important than previously thought, and may guide the design of robotic prostheses that improve balance.},

The effects of this tendency have been repeatedly documented in clinical research. However, its ramifications for the behavior of scientists have yet to be adequately explored. For example, although publication is a critical element in determining the contribution and impact of scientific findings, little research attention has been devoted to the variables operative in journal review policies. In the present study, 75 journal reviewers were asked to referee manuscripts which described identical experimental procedures but which reported positive, negative, mixed, or no results. In addition to showing poor interrater agreement, reviewers were strongly biased against manuscripts which reported results contrary to their theoretical perspective. The implications of these findings for epistemology and the peer review system are briefly addressed.},

Although numerous studies have found that SETs correlate with various teaching effectiveness irrelevant factors (TEIFs) such as subject, class size, and grading standards, it has been argued that such correlations are small and do not undermine the validity of SETs as measures of professors' teaching effectiveness. However, previous research has generally used inappropriate parametric statistics and effect sizes to examine and to evaluate the significance of TEIFs on personnel decisions. Accordingly, we examined the influence of quantitative vs. non-quantitative courses on SET ratings and SET based personnel decisions using 14,872 publicly posted class evaluations where each evaluation represents a summary of SET ratings provided by individual students responding in each class. In total, 325,538 individual student evaluations from a US mid-size university contributed to theses class evaluations. The results demonstrate that class subject (math vs. English) is strongly associated with SET ratings, has a substantial impact on professors being labeled satisfactory vs. unsatisfactory and excellent vs. non-excellent, and the impact varies substantially depending on the criteria used to classify professors as satisfactory vs. unsatisfactory. Professors teaching quantitative courses are far more likely not to receive tenure, promotion, and/or merit pay when their performance is evaluated against common standards.},

  abstract = {Solving an optimal control or estimation problem is not easy. Pieces of the puzzle are found scattered throughout many different disciplines. Furthermore, the focus of this book is on practical methods, that is, methods that I have found actually work! In fact everything described in this book has been implemented in production software and used to solve real optimal control problems. Although the reader should be proficient in advanced mathematics, no theorems are presented. Traditionally, there are two major parts of a successful optimal control or optimal estimation solution technique. The first part is the ``optimization'' method. The second part is the ``differential equation'' method. When faced with an optimal control or estimation problem it is tempting to simply ``paste'' together packages for optimization and numerical integration. While naive approaches such as this may be moderately successful, the goal of this book is to suggest that there is a better way! The methods used to solve the differential equations and optimize the functions are intimately related. The first two chapters of this book focus on the optimization part of the problem. In Chapter 1 the important concepts of nonlinear programming for small dense applications are introduced. Chapter 2 extends the presentation to problems which are both large and sparse. Chapters 3 and 4 address the differential equation part of the problem. Chapter 3 introduces relevant material in the numerical solution of differential (and differentialalgebraic) equations. Methods for solving the optimal control problem are treated in some detail in Chapter 4. Throughout the book the interaction between optimization and integration is emphasized. Chapter 5 describes how to solve optimal estimation problems. Chapter 6 presents a collection of examples that illustrate the various concepts and techniques. Real world problems often require solving a sequence of optimal control and/or optimization problems, and Chapter 7 describes a collection of these ``advanced applications.'' While the book incorporates a great deal of new material not covered in Practical Methods for Optimal Control Using Nonlinear Programming [21], it does not cover everything. Many important topics are simply not discussed in order to keep the overall presentation concise and focused. The discussion is general and presents a unified approach to solving optimal estimation and control problems. Most of the examples are drawn from my experience in the aerospace industry. Examples have been solved using a particular implementation called  $\mathbb{S}\mathbb{O}\mathbb{C}\mathbb{S}$.SOCS.$<$math display="inline" overflow="scroll"$>$ $<$mrow$><$mi mathvariant="double-struck"$>$SOCS$<$/mi$><$mo$>$.$<$/mo$><$/mrow$>$ $<$/math$>$  I have tried to adhere to notational conventions from both optimization and control theory whenever possible.

  doi = {10.1016/j.jbiomech.2017.06.018},
  abstract = {Increased time-delay in the neuromuscular system caused by neurological disorders, concussions, or advancing age is an important factor contributing to balance loss (Chagdes et al., 2013, 2016a,b). We present the design and fabrication of an active balance board system that allows for a systematic study of stiffness and time-delay induced instabilities in standing posture. Although current commercial balance boards allow for variable stiffness, they do not allow for manipulation of time-delay. Having two controllable parameters can more accurately determine the cause of balance deficiencies, and allows us to induce instabilities even in healthy populations. An inverted pendulum model of human posture on such an active balance board predicts that reduced board rotational stiffness destabilizes upright posture through board tipping, and limit cycle oscillations about the upright position emerge as feedback time-delay is increased. We validate these two mechanisms of instability on the designed balance board, showing that rotational stiffness and board time-delay induced the predicted postural instabilities in healthy, young adults. Although current commercial balance boards utilize control of rotational stiffness, real-time control of both stiffness and time-delay on an active balance board is a novel and innovative manipulation to reveal balance deficiencies and potentially improve individualized balance training by targeting multiple dimensions contributing to standing balance.},

  abstract = {Wearable robotic devices can restore and enhance mobility. There is growing interest in designing devices that reduce the metabolic cost of walking; however, designers lack guidelines for which joints to assist and when to provide the assistance. To help address this problem, we used musculoskeletal simulation to predict how hypothetical devices affect muscle activity and metabolic cost when walking with heavy loads. We explored 7 massless devices, each providing unrestricted torque at one degree of freedom in one direction (hip abduction, hip flexion, hip extension, knee flexion, knee extension, ankle plantarflexion, or ankle dorsiflexion). We used the Computed Muscle Control algorithm in OpenSim to find device torque profiles that minimized the sum of squared muscle activations while tracking measured kinematics of loaded walking without assistance. We then examined the metabolic savings provided by each device, the corresponding device torque profiles, and the resulting changes in muscle activity. We found that the hip flexion, knee flexion, and hip abduction devices provided greater metabolic savings than the ankle plantarflexion device. The hip abduction device had the greatest ratio of metabolic savings to peak instantaneous positive device power, suggesting that frontal-plane hip assistance may be an efficient way to reduce metabolic cost. Overall, the device torque profiles generally differed from the corresponding net joint moment generated by muscles without assistance, and occasionally exceeded the net joint moment to reduce muscle activity at other degrees of freedom. Many devices affected the activity of muscles elsewhere in the limb; for example, the hip flexion device affected muscles that span the ankle joint. Our results may help experimentalists decide which joint motions to target when building devices and can provide intuition for how devices may interact with the musculoskeletal system. The simulations are freely available online, allowing others to reproduce and extend our work.},

Generally, beliefs can find support from at least two different routes of information processing: social/moral considerations or analytic/empirical reasoning. Here, we investigate how these two psychological constructs relate to dogmatism in two groups of individuals who preferentially draw on the former or latter sort of information when forming beliefs about the world\textemdash{}religious and nonreligious individuals. Across two studies and their pooled analysis, we provide evidence that although dogmatism is negatively related to analytic reasoning in both groups of individuals, it shares a divergent relationship with measures of moral concern depending on whether one identifies as religious or not. Study 1 showed that increasing levels of dogmatism were positively related to prosocial intentions among the religious and negatively related to empathic concern among the nonreligious. Study 2 replicated and extended these results by showing that perspective taking is negatively related to dogmatism in both groups, an effect which is particularly robust among the nonreligious. Study 2 also showed that religious fundamentalism was positively related to measures of moral concern among the religious. Because the current studies used a content-neutral measure to assess dogmatic certainty in one's beliefs, they have the potential to inform practices for most effectively communicating with and persuading religious and nonreligious individuals to change maladaptive behavior, even when the mode of discourse is unrelated to religious belief.},

  abstract = {This work explores the collision process at foot contact in models of legged robots. In particular, we highlight that for legged systems the widely used assumption of no sliding of the contact points can yield inconsistent outcomes. For certain contact configurations and system parameters, neither the assumption of lift-off of the trailing foot nor the assumption that it stays fixed on the ground yield valid solutions. The foot will slide, even if an infinite coefficient of friction is assumed. In a related effect, we present configurations in which the solution of the collision process is ambiguous. These behaviors are examined for the models of a minimalistic biped, a passive dynamic walker, and the five-link bipedal robot RAMone. The paper provides background for these non-intuitive behaviors and investigates the influence of system parameters onto the collision behavior of a passive dynamic walker. By studying bipedal models that range from minimalistic to physically accurate, this paper establishes a bridge between the theoretical study of unilateral contact in multibody dynamic simulations and the application of these simulation methods in the modeling of ground contact in actual legged systems.},

Exoskeletons can be used to augment human abilities\textemdash{}for example, to lift very heavy loads or to provide greater endurance. For each user, though, a device will need to be adjusted for optimum effect, which can be time-consuming. Zhang et al. show that the human can be included in the optimization process, with real-time adaptation of an ankle exoskeleton (see the Perspective by Malcolm et al.). By using indirect calorimetry to measure metabolic rates, the authors were able to adjust the torque provided by the device while users were walking, running, and carrying a load.
Science, this issue p. 1280; see also p. 1230
Exoskeletons and active prostheses promise to enhance human mobility, but few have succeeded. Optimizing device characteristics on the basis of measured human performance could lead to improved designs. We have developed a method for identifying the exoskeleton assistance that minimizes human energy cost during walking. Optimized torque patterns from an exoskeleton worn on one ankle reduced metabolic energy consumption by 24.2 $\pm$ 7.4\% compared to no torque. The approach was effective with exoskeletons worn on one or both ankles, during a variety of walking conditions, during running, and when optimizing muscle activity. Finding a good generic assistance pattern, customizing it to individual needs, and helping users learn to take advantage of the device all contributed to improved economy. Optimization methods with these features can substantially improve performance.
An exoskeleton control system can optimize itself by measuring and minimizing human energy use during walking.

Chip seals are economical as a surface for lower-volume roads or for preservation treatments on asphalt roads, and the technology for increasing the life span of chip seals is continually improving. Chip seals often have higher macrotexture than do asphalt or concrete surfaces, which provides high skid resistance for motor vehicles. However, bicycling has increased in many parts of the country, for both recreation and commuting, and the high macrotexture of chip seals has led bicyclists to protest that the use of chip seals has decreased the comfort of recreational bicycle rides. In California, recreational bicyclists have contacted the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) regarding the texture of chip seals on popular bicycling routes. Caltrans sponsored research to measure pavement surface macrotexture and roughness, to conduct bicycle ride quality surveys in partnership with six California bicycling clubs, and to do preliminary modeling. These data have been used to develop further a multilevel binomial regression model that indicated that surface macrotexture and roughness have a strong impact on perceived bicycle comfort levels. The model could be used to develop design guidelines for urban and rural bicycle routes.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study is to compare the safety of cyclists in five bicycle facility layouts in signalized intersections at various traffic volumes in order to assess if some layouts are better than others with regards to cyclist safety and to develop methods to facilitate this comparison. The five layouts included two full-length bicycle tracks with and without separate right-turning lane, two truncated bicycle tracks \textendash{} one in which cyclists and right-turning vehicles merge in the right-turning lane, one continued into a narrow bicycle lane \textendash{} and a recessed bicycle track. Using two different definitions of traffic conflicts the safety of cyclists in each layout is calculated as the risk of a cyclist being involved in a conflict with left- and right-turning vehicles at low, medium and high vehicle volumes, respectively. In total, around 35,500 left-turning vehicles, 38,000 right-turning vehicles and 16,000 cyclists going straight ahead were observed, resulting in 12 left-hook and 25 right-hook traffic conflicts for the reaction-based indicator and 25 left-hook and 80 right-hook traffic conflicts for the time-based indicator. The results show that regardless of which of the two conflict indicators were used, the number of conflicts was too small to make firm conclusions about which layout is safest for cyclists at various traffic volumes, although the study was based on 80h of video recordings from each of the five intersections. However, a recessed bicycle track seems to be safer than the other geometric layouts. In order to facilitate the detection of conflicts, we developed watchdog video analysis software to reduce the amount of video. This software compressed 400h of video into 64h, i.e. 16\% of its original length. The use of this software is particularly important to provide enough conflicts for an analysis if even larger traffic conflict studies should be carried out.},

This ``cybernetic approach'' enables objective and quantitative comparisons of human behavior, and allows a systematic optimization of human control interfaces and training associated with manual control. Current cybernetics theory is primarily based on technology and analysis methods formalized in the 1960s and has shown to be limited in its capability to capture the full breadth of human cognition and control. This paper reviews the current state-of-the-art in our knowledge of human manual control, points out the main fundamental limitations in cybernetics, and proposes a possible roadmap to advance the theory and its applications. Central in this roadmap will be a shift from the current linear time-invariant modeling approach that is only truly valid for human behavior under tightly controlled and stationary conditions, to methods that facilitate the analysis of adaptive, and possibly time-varying, human behavior in realistic control tasks. Examples of key current developments in the field of cybernetics\textemdash{}human use of preview, predictable discrete maneuvering, skill acquisition and training, time-varying human modeling, and neuromuscular system modeling\textemdash{}that contribute to this shift are presented in this paper. The new foundations for cybernetics that will emerge from these efforts will impact all domains that involve humans in manual and semiautomatic control.},

The most prominent example of an unstable lively bridge is the London Millennium Bridge, which started wobbling as a result of pedestrian-bridge interactions. Pedestrian phase locking due to footstep phase adjustment is suspected to be the main cause of its large lateral vibrations; however, its role in the initiation of wobbling was debated. We develop foot force models of pedestrians' response to bridge motion and detailed, yet analytically tractable, models of crowd phase locking. We use biomechanically inspired models of crowd lateral movement to investigate to what degree pedestrian synchrony must be present for a bridge to wobble significantly and what is a critical crowd size. Our results can be used as a safety guideline for designing pedestrian bridges or limiting the maximum occupancy of an existing bridge. The pedestrian models can be used as ``crash test dummies'' when numerically probing a specific bridge design. This is particularly important because the U.S. code for designing pedestrian bridges does not contain explicit guidelines that account for the collective pedestrian behavior.
This study develops ``crash test dummies'' to help designers avoid their footbridges oscillating or bouncing alarmingly.

  abstract = {The sharing and re-use of data has become a cornerstone of modern science. Multiple platforms now allow quick and easy data sharing. So far, however, data publishing models have not accommodated on-going scientific improvements in data: for many problems, datasets continue to grow with time -- more records are added, errors fixed, and new data structures are created. In other words, datasets, like scientific knowledge, advance with time. We therefore suggest that many datasets would be usefully published as a series of versions, with a simple naming system to allow users to perceive the type of change between versions. In this article, we argue for adopting the paradigm and processes for versioned data, analogous to software versioning. We also introduce a system called Versioned Data Delivery and present tools for creating, archiving, and distributing versioned data easily, quickly, and cheaply. These new tools allow for individual research groups to shift from a static model of data curation to a dynamic and versioned model that more naturally matches the scientific process.},

These results advance our ability to quantify the influence of prestige in academia and shed new light on the academic system.

  abstract = {Many algorithm visualizations have been created, but little is known about which features are most important to their success. We believe that pedagogically useful visualizations exhibit certain features that hold across a wide range of visualization styles and content. We began our efforts to identify these features with a review that attempted to identify an initial set of candidates. We then ran two experiments that attempted to identify the effectiveness for a subset of features from the list. We identified a small number of features for algorithm visualizations that seem to have a significant impact on their pedagogical effectiveness, and found that several others appear to have little impact. The single most important feature studied is the ability to directly control the pace of the visualization. An algorithm visualization having a minimum of distracting features, and which focuses on the logical steps of an algorithm, appears to be best for procedural understanding of the algorithm. Providing a good example for the visualization to operate on proved significantly more effective than letting students construct their own data sets. Finally, a pseudocode display, a series of questions to guide exploration of the algorithm, or the ability to back up within the visualization did not show a significant effect on learning.},

This study tested a new virtual reality (VR) technique for anatomy learning based on virtual contrast injection. The aim was to assess whether students value this new three-dimensional (3D) visualization method as a learning tool and what value they gain from its use in reaching their anatomical learning objectives. Several 3D vascular VR models were created using an interactive segmentation tool based on the ``virtual contrast injection'' method. This method allows users, with relative ease, to convert computer tomography or magnetic resonance images into vivid 3D VR movies using the OsiriX software equipped with the CMIV CTA plug-in. Once created using the segmentation tool, the image series were exported in Quick Time Virtual Reality (QTVR) format and integrated within a web framework of the Educational Virtual Anatomy (EVA) program. A total of nine QTVR movies were produced encompassing most of the major arteries of the body. These movies were supplemented with associated information, color keys, and notes. The results indicate that, in general, students' attitudes towards the EVA-program were positive when compared with anatomy textbooks, but results were not the same with dissections.

  abstract = {Computer-based multimedia learning environments make it possible to present interactive animated pictures, which can be manipulated for active exploratory learning and which allow the dynamic behavior of complex subject matter to be displayed. Due to the large range of possibilities for exploratory interaction, such learning environments seem well suited for co-operative learning in which different learners analyse the presented subject matter from different perspectives. This paper first describes a theoretical framework for learning from texts and pictures together with an analysis of possible effects of animation and interactivity on knowledge acquisition. It then presents two empirical studies in which knowledge acquisition from interactive animated pictures was compared with knowledge acquisition from static pictures under the conditions of individual learning (Study I) and of cooperative learning (Study II). In Study I, learning with interactive animated pictures resulted in a superior encoding of detail information, but did not facilitate performance of mental simulation tasks. In Study II, learning with interactive animated pictures resulted both in inferior encoding of detail information and poorer results in mental simulations. These findings and the analysis of discourse protocols of subjects' co-operation suggest that exploratory learning with interactive animated pictures is associated with extraneous cognitive load and that this load can be further increased by the co-ordination demands of co-operative learning. Although animated pictures may provide external support for mental simulations, they do not appear to be generally beneficial for learning, because they can prevent individuals from performing relevant cognitive processes.},

Rigor accomplishes dirty deeds, however, serving three primary ends across engineering, engineering education, and engineering education research: disciplining, demarcating boundaries, and demonstrating white male heterosexual privilege. Understanding how rigor reproduces inequality, we cannot reinvent it but rather must relinquish it, looking to alternative conceptualizations for evaluating knowledge, welcoming diverse ways of knowing, doing, and being, and moving from compliance to engagement, from rigor to vigor.},

  abstract = {We address the problem of fusing array operations based on criteria such as shape compatibility, data reuse, and minimizing for data reuse, the fusion problem has been formulated as a static weighted graph partitioning problem (known as the Weighted Loop Fusion problem). We show that this scheme cannot accurately track data reuse between multiple independent loops, since it overestimates total data reuse of certain cases. Our formulation in terms of partitions allows use of realistic cost functions that can track resource usage accurately. We give correctness proofs, and prove that WSP can maximize data reuse in programs exactly, in contrast to prior work. For the exact optimal solution, which is NP-hard to find, we present a branch-and-bound algorithm together with a polynomial-time preconditioner that reduces the problem size significantly in practice. We further present a polynomial-time greedy approximation that is fast enough to use for JIT-compilation and gives near-optimal results in practice. All algorithms have been implemented in the automatic parallelization platform Bohrium, run on a set of benchmarks, and compared to existing methods from the literature.},

As such, below-knee prosthesis users rely on proactive control strategies to maintain locomotor stability. However, there are trade-offs (metabolic, comfort, etc.) associated with proactive strategies. We hypothesize that because proactive control strategies are costly, prosthesis users and non-impaired participants will use a priori knowledge (timing, direction) of an impending lateral perturbation to make specific gait adaptations only when the timing of the perturbation is known and the~adaptation can be temporally-limited. This hypothesis was partially supported. When the perturbation timing was predictable, only prosthesis users, and only on their impaired side, increased their lateral margin of stability during the steps immediately preceding the perturbation when perturbation direction was either unknown or known to be directed towards their impaired side. This strategy should reduce the likelihood of requiring a corrective step to maintain stability. However, neither group exhibited substantial proactive adaptations compared to baseline walking when perturbation timing was unpredictable, independent of perturbation direction knowledge. The absence of further proactive stabilization behaviors observed in prosthesis users in anticipation of a certain but temporally unpredictable perturbation may be partially responsible for impaired balance control.},

Replicating all aspects of the NIH peer-review process, we examined 43 individual reviewers' ratings and written critiques of the same group of 25 NIH grant applications. Results showed no agreement among reviewers regarding the quality of the applications in either their qualitative or quantitative evaluations. Although all reviewers received the same instructions on how to rate applications and format their written critiques, we also found no agreement in how reviewers ``translated'' a given number of strengths and weaknesses into a numeric rating. It appeared that the outcome of the grant review depended more on the reviewer to whom the grant was assigned than the research proposed in the grant.

  volume = {106},
  issn = {2168-9830},
  doi = {10.1002/jee.20161},
  abstract = {Background

Numerous studies have identified a gap between the writing skills of engineering program graduates and the demands of writing in the workplace; however, few studies have analyzed the writing of practitioners and students to better understand that gap and inform teaching materials.

Purpose

This study sought to compare word-level, sentence-level, and organizational differences in writing by practitioners and students and to identify differences that are important for engineering practice. I also sought to demonstrate the untapped potential for linguistic analyses to contribute to understanding engineering writing.

Design/Method

I used techniques from applied linguistics \textendash{} corpus linguistics and rhetorical move analysis \textendash{} supplemented with interviews of practitioners and students. The analysis investigated the interaction of language features, their functions, and writers' motivations.

Results

Student writing had more complicated sentence structures, less accurate word choice, more errors in grammar and punctuation, and less linear organization. These characteristics decreased effectiveness in areas that practitioners considered important: accurate and unambiguous content; fast, predicable reading; liability management; and attention to detail. Underlying the student writing problems were misconceptions about effective writing, ignorance of genre expectations, weak language skills, and a failure to appreciate that written words, not just calculations, express engineering content.

Conclusions

The findings better define the gap between student and practitioner writing, and are a basis for instructional materials that target important student writing weaknesses.},

  shorttitle = {The {{Surprising Creativity}} of {{Digital Evolution}}},
  abstract = {Biological evolution provides a creative fount of complex and subtle adaptations, often surprising the scientists who discover them. However, because evolution is an algorithmic process that transcends the substrate in which it occurs, evolution's creativity is not limited to nature. Indeed, many researchers in the field of digital evolution have observed their evolving algorithms and organisms subverting their intentions, exposing unrecognized bugs in their code, producing unexpected adaptations, or exhibiting outcomes uncannily convergent with ones in nature. Such stories routinely reveal creativity by evolution in these digital worlds, but they rarely fit into the standard scientific narrative. Instead they are often treated as mere obstacles to be overcome, rather than results that warrant study in their own right. The stories themselves are traded among researchers through oral tradition, but that mode of information transmission is inefficient and prone to error and outright loss. Moreover, the fact that these stories tend to be shared only among practitioners means that many natural scientists do not realize how interesting and lifelike digital organisms are and how natural their evolution can be. To our knowledge, no collection of such anecdotes has been published before. This paper is the crowd-sourced product of researchers in the fields of artificial life and evolutionary computation who have provided first-hand accounts of such cases. It thus serves as a written, fact-checked collection of scientifically important and even entertaining stories. In doing so we also present here substantial evidence that the existence and importance of evolutionary surprises extends beyond the natural world, and may indeed be a universal property of all complex evolving systems.},

  abstract = {The quality of a worker's commute significantly impacts her well-being. We seek to add to the nascent literature on this topic by examining how travel mode, location, and other personal characteristics are associated with perceived commute quality and then by exploring implications for commute satisfaction. We use data from the annual Campus Travel Survey of students and employees at the University of California, Davis and focus on three dimensions of the commute experience: how stressful the commute to campus is, whether travel time is seen as wasted time, and the degree to which commuters like their travel mode. Our analysis shows that commute quality differs by residential location, commute mode, student versus employee status, and gender. Overall, bicycle commuters and train commuters report the highest quality commutes, all else equal; bus riders report the lowest quality commutes; the results for those traveling to campus by car are somewhere in the middle. We also find that all three dimensions of perceived commute quality are strongly associated with overall commute satisfaction. These results point to several different strategies for employers like UC Davis that aim to improve commute quality in order to enhance well-being: improve the quality of each mode, encourage a shift to modes offering higher quality commutes, identify ``mis-matched'' employees who are not using the mode that would yield the highest commute satisfaction, use social marketing techniques to change perceptions of and preferences for commute options, and increase housing near work sites to enable more commuters to live within bicycling distance.},

Kinematic (120Hz) and GRF data were collected at trot from three trials of eight horses using four force plates (960Hz). Forelimb and hind limb GRFs were measured, COP was calculated from the resultant vertical GRF vector and COM was calculated by summation of weighted segmental COMs. Peak total vertical force (19.3$\pm$1.3N/kg at 45.1$\pm$2.3\% diagonal stance) coincided with zero total longitudinal force (45.1$\pm$2.4\% stance). Initially, COP position corresponded with the fore or hind hoof of the diagonal that contacted the ground earlier. During diagonal overlap, COP position reflected forelimb contribution to total vertical GRF; it maintained a fairly constant position relative to the base of support through the middle part of stance, then moved cranially in the last third of stance towards the fore hoof, which was always the last hoof to leave the ground. The COM moved forward continuously; its longitudinal velocity decreased with the net braking force in early stance and increased with the net propulsive force in late stance. The COM was caudal to the COP in early stance, coincident at 35.8$\pm$4.4\% stance and was maximally ahead of the COP at 67.6$\pm$4.8\% stance. Changes in the spatial relationship between COP and COM affect the moment arms of the forelimb and hind limb vertical GRFs and their effect in generating a pitching torque around the COM.},

  abstract = {Ski jump landing surface shapes can be created to cushion jumper landing by specifying a value of equivalent fall height (EFH) but, because the shape is calculated by integrating a differential equation, an infinite number of solutions results from the arbitrary boundary conditions. This paper provides a natural rationale for selection of the least expensive (minimum snow budget) one of these that nevertheless satisfies other design constraints, mainly limited normal acceleration and jerk during approach and landing transitions. Choosing the maximum allowable normal acceleration during the approach transition brings the entire infinite family of landing surfaces as close as possible to the parent slope. Limiting the rate of change of normal acceleration (jerk) decreases the likelihood of loss of balance at takeoff and consequent catastrophic spinal cord injuries on landing. An analogous choice, satisfying limited normal acceleration during the landing transition, selects the single member of the infinite family (providing the desired EFH) that lies closest to the parent slope and is therefore least costly to build. Software in the form of a graphical user interface is described that implements these algorithms and is appropriate for inexperienced users to calculate design details before actual fabrication of landing surfaces at a specific jump site.},

This results in lack of identifiability in the estimation problem. Therefore, we propose two systematic methods to select a sensitive parameter subset to be estimated, while fixing the remaining parameters to values obtained from preliminary estimation. The selection approach relies on identifying the parameter subset to which the measurement output is most sensitive. The proposed methods are based on the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) and the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). 95\% confidence intervals of the parameter estimates were computed using model-based bootstrap. We presented an application of identifying a parametric model of a head rotational position-tracking test for human subjects. Our methods led to reduced model complexity (less number of parameters to be estimated), narrow confidence intervals of the parameter estimates, and accepted goodness of fit.},

Many educational and governmental bodies have called for and supported adoption of these student-centered strategies throughout the undergraduate STEM curriculum. But to the extent that we have pictures of the STEM undergraduate instructional landscape, it has mostly been provided through self-report surveys of faculty members, within a particular STEM discipline [e.g., (3\textendash{}6)]. Such surveys are prone to reliability threats and can underestimate the complexity of classroom environments, and few are implemented nationally to provide valid and reliable data (7). Reflecting the limited state of these data, a report from the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine called for improved data collection to understand the use of evidence-based instructional practices (8). We report here a major step toward a characterization of STEM teaching practices in North American universities based on classroom observations from over 2000 classes taught by more than 500 STEM faculty members across 25 institutions.

  abstract = {The reinforcement learning paradigm allows, in principle, for complex behaviours to be learned directly from simple reward signals. In practice, however, it is common to carefully hand-design the reward function to encourage a particular solution, or to derive it from demonstration data. In this paper explore how a rich environment can help to promote the learning of complex behavior. Specifically, we train agents in diverse environmental contexts, and find that this encourages the emergence of robust behaviours that perform well across a suite of tasks. We demonstrate this principle for locomotion -- behaviours that are known for their sensitivity to the choice of reward. We train several simulated bodies on a diverse set of challenging terrains and obstacles, using a simple reward function based on forward progress. Using a novel scalable variant of policy gradient reinforcement learning, our agents learn to run, jump, crouch and turn as required by the environment without explicit reward-based guidance.

  abstract = {This thesis explores the recent rise of skiing and snowboarding injuries from jumps fabricated with no scientific design process. It summarizes a previous method to develop a first order ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the landing surface shape, based on kinematics and dynamics, which limits the equivalent fall height (EFH) on landing. These are compared with theoretical expressions for EFH in tabletop jumps, which are shown to have linearly increasing and possibly large EFH values near the ends of the tabletop and linear landing surface portions. Finding solutions to the ODE is explored, with a large emphasis on determining the singular point where the ODE numerical integration can begin. Analysis is conducted to determine a good way to design a curved in-run transition portion of the jump that limits the additional centripetal acceleration on a particle undergoing the required velocity change of direction of a given amount. This turn can be accomplished using a unique curve known as a clothoid, which minimizes jerk along the path. The final topics include a plan for providing maintenance for safe terrain park ski jumps, and an algorithm that will assist a manager in planning where and how to build a jump.},

To validate the simulated results, the simulated velocity and accelerations are compared with the data acquired with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) installed on the bicycle. The paper describes the experimental setup of the instrumented bicycle, enabling readers to build the very same system for their own educational use.

  abstract = {The linear quadratic regulator (LQR) is a classical optimal control approach that can regulate gait dynamics about target kinematic trajectories. Exoskeletons to restore gait function have conventionally utilized time-varying proportional-derivative (PD) control of leg joints. But, these PD parameters are not uniquely optimized for whole-body (full-state) performance. The objective of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of LQR full-state feedback compared to PD control to maintain bipedal walking of a sagittal-plane computational model against force disturbances. Several LQR controllers were uniquely solved with feedback gains optimized for different levels of tracking capability versus control effort. The main implications to future exoskeleton control systems include (1) which LQR controllers out-perform PD controllers in walking maintenance and effort, (2) verifying that LQR desirably produces joint torques that oppose rapidly growing joint state errors, and (3) potentially equipping accurate sensing systems for nonjoint states such as hip-position and torso orientation. The LQR controllers capable of longer walk times than respective PD controllers also required less control effort. During sudden leg collapse, LQR desirably behaved like PD by generating feedback torques that opposed the direction of leg-joint errors. Feedback from nonjoint states contributed to over 50\% of the LQR joint torques and appear critical for whole-body LQR control. While LQR control poses implementation challenges, such as more sensors for full-state feedback and operation near the desired trajectories, it offers significant performance advantages over PD control.},

  doi = {10.1520/STP47480S},
  abstract = {Skiing and snowboarding have become more acrobatic with terrain park jumps and other manmade features playing a prominent role in an increase in serious spinal cord injuries. Yet these jumps rarely, if ever, involve formal or detailed design or engineering. This paper presents a coherent theory and methodology for the design of ski jump landing surfaces. The motion of the skier center of mass is modeled. Although jumpers may land in many configurations, we assume that the probability of severe landing injury is correlated with the component of skier velocity perpendicular ͑normal͒ to the landing surface v\cyrchar{\'\CYRK} or, more understandably, with the corresponding equivalent fall height ͑EFH͒. The requirement that v\cyrchar{\'\CYRK} and EFH be small is satisfied by making the landing surface nearly parallel to the skier flight path at landing. Safer landing surfaces that limit EFH to a given value are shown to satisfy a first order ordinary differential equation ͑ODE͒. Having chosen an EFH deemed safe enough by the designer, integration of this ODE provides members of an infinite family of landing surfaces that limit the EFH to the desired value, for any jumper in-run velocity. Using the takeoff ramp angle as another design variable, one can choose a member of this family to fit on almost any available jump site. The formulation incorporates the fact that skiers can slightly modify velocity direction and magnitude at takeoff by jumping and is valid for any landing body configuration. Such landing surfaces can still yield exhilarating flight experiences with relatively large flight times and air height above the surface, but without the danger posed by jumps created in an ad hoc manner, which can expose the skier to much larger unsafe equivalent fall heights.},

It has also been shown that the severity of impact risk can be characterized by equivalent fall height (EFH), a measure of jumper impact velocity normal to the slope, and that design algorithms exist to calculate landing-surface shapes that limit EFH to arbitrarily low values. Although proposals have been made recently to introduce design, the skiing industry and other authors have objected that analysis, design, and standards are impossible because of various ``uncontrollable'' factors that allegedly make the problem intractable to analytical design techniques. We consider the list of uncontrollable factors one by one and show that, to the contrary, each is either: (1) irrelevant to design, (2) has negligible effect, if any, on designed EFH, or (3) can be directly incorporated into the design process.},

  shorttitle = {Modeling {{Terrain Park Jumps}}},
  abstract = {Terrain park tabletop jumps have a shape that is common at many ski areas today. A safe, low-impact landing on any jump with a constant linear landing area requires that the component of jumper velocity perpendicular to the landing surface be small, and when velocities are large, achieving this requires that the jumper flight path angle be nearly equal to the landing surface angle. Landing impact severity can alternatively be measured using the equivalent fall height (EFH). Based on Newton's laws and assumed ballistic flight, this research presents a general expression for the EFH experienced by a jumper when landing at any possible point on any landing surface whatsoever. This general expression is then particularized to show the effects on the EFH of the four physical features of a generic tabletop jump with a flat, horizontal deck and a constant linear landing region: the takeoff angle h0, the coordinates of the knuckle xt and yt where the intended constant-slope landing region begins, and the snow landing surface angle u in this region. Numerical results show that tabletop jump EFHs have increasing and possibly large values near the ends of both the tabletop and the linear landing downslope portions. We conclude that tabletop jumps do not exhibit a low impulse on landing everywhere, which increases the likelihood of jumper injuries relative to those jumps for which the EFH is small everywhere.},

  abstract = {Background: Test-driven development (TDD) is a technique that repeats short coding cycles interleaved with testing. The developer first writes a unit test for the desired functionality, followed by the necessary production code, and refactors the code. Many empirical studies neglect unique process characteristics related to TDD iterative nature. Aim: We formulate four process characteristic: sequencing, granularity, uniformity, and refactoring effort. We investigate how these characteristics impact quality and productivity in TDD and related variations. Method: We analyzed 82 data points collected from 39 professionals, each capturing the process used while performing a specific development task. We built regression models to assess the impact of process characteristics on quality and productivity. Quality was measured by functional correctness. Result: Quality and productivity improvements were primarily positively associated with the granularity and uniformity. Sequencing, the order in which test and production code are written, had no important influence. Refactoring effort was negatively associated with both outcomes. We explain the unexpected negative correlation with quality by possible prevalence of mixed refactoring. Conclusion: The claimed benefits of TDD may not be due to its distinctive test-first dynamic, but rather due to the fact that TDD-like processes encourage fine-grained, steady steps that improve focus and flow.},

Linear feedback of the state variables for stationary linear plants permits choice of the gains to place poles (eigenvalues) of the controlled system in desired locations. Continuous estimates of the state variables can often be made from one or more measurements of the output using a filter of the same (or lower) order as the plant called "an observer": the poles of the observer can be placed arbitrarily through choice of the observer gains. Combining an observer with state-variable feedback yields a "compensator" design; the poles of the controlled system are the poles of the observer plus the poles of plant with state-variable feedback, which greatly simplifies the design problem.},

  title = {A {{Survey}} of {{Symbolic Execution Techniques}}},
  abstract = {Many security and software testing applications require checking whether certain properties of a program hold for any possible usage scenario. For instance, a tool for identifying software vulnerabilities may need to rule out the existence of any backdoor to bypass a program's authentication. One approach would be to test the program using different, possibly random inputs. As the backdoor may only be hit for very specific program workloads, automated exploration of the space of possible inputs is of the essence. Symbolic execution provides an elegant solution to the problem, by systematically exploring many possible execution paths at the same time without necessarily requiring concrete inputs. Rather than taking on fully specified input values, the technique abstractly represents them as symbols, resorting to constraint solvers to construct actual instances that would cause property violations. Symbolic execution has been incubated in dozens of tools developed over the last four decades, leading to major practical breakthroughs in a number of prominent software reliability applications. The goal of this survey is to provide an overview of the main ideas, challenges, and solutions developed in the area, distilling them for a broad audience.

  abstract = {During human walking, the centre of mass (CoM) is outside the base of support for most of the time, which poses a challenge to stabilizing the gait pattern. Nevertheless, most of us are able to walk without substantial problems. In this review, we aim to provide an integrative overview of how humans cope with an underactuated gait pattern. A central idea that emerges from the literature is that foot placement is crucial in maintaining a stable gait pattern. In this review, we explore this idea; we first describe mechanical models and concepts that have been used to predict how foot placement can be used to control gait stability. These concepts, such as for instance the extrapolated CoM concept, the foot placement estimator concept and the capture point concept, provide explicit predictions on where to place the foot relative to the body at each step, such that gait is stabilized. Next, we describe empirical findings on foot placement during human gait in unperturbed and perturbed conditions. We conclude that humans show behaviour that is largely in accordance with the aforementioned concepts, with foot placement being actively coordinated to body CoM kinematics during the preceding step. In this section, we also address the requirements for such control in terms of the sensory information and the motor strategies that can implement such control, as well as the parts of the central nervous system that may be involved. We show that visual, vestibular and proprioceptive information contribute to estimation of the state of the CoM. Foot placement is adjusted to variations in CoM state mainly by modulation of hip abductor muscle activity during the swing phase of gait, and this process appears to be under spinal and supraspinal, including cortical, control. We conclude with a description of how control of foot placement can be impaired in humans, using ageing as a primary example and with some reference to pathology, and we address alternative strategies available to stabilize gait, which include modulation of ankle moments in the stance leg and changes in body angular momentum, such as rapid trunk tilts. Finally, for future research, we believe that especially the integration of consideration of environmental constraints on foot placement with balance control deserves attention.},

A novel intervention in this space is the creation of open access publishing platforms commissioned by funding organisations. Examples include those of the Wellcome Trust and the Gates Foundation, as well as recently announced initiatives from public funders like the European Commission and the Irish Health Research Board. As the number of such platforms increases, it becomes urgently necessary to assess in which ways, for better or worse, this emergent phenomenon complements or disrupts the scholarly communications landscape. This article examines ethical, organisational and economic strengths and weaknesses of such platforms, as well as usage and uptake to date, to scope the opportunities and threats presented by funder open access platforms in the ongoing transition to open access. The article is broadly supportive of the aims and current implementations of such platforms, finding them a novel intervention which stand to help increase OA uptake, control costs of OA, lower administrative burden on researchers, and demonstrate funders' commitment to fostering open practices. However, the article identifies key areas of concern about the potential for unintended consequences, including the appearance of conflicts of interest, difficulties of scale, potential lock-in and issues of the branding of research. The article ends with key recommendations for future consideration which include a focus on open scholarly infrastructure.},

  abstract = {Goal: Technologies that augment human performance are the focus of intensive research and development, driven by advances in wearable robotic systems. Success has been limited by the challenge of understanding human-robot interaction. To address this challenge, we developed an optimization framework to synthesize a realistic human standing long jump and used the framework to explore how simulated wearable robotic devices might enhance jump performance. Methods: A planar, five-segment, seven-degree-of-freedom model with physiological torque actuators, which have variable torque capacity depending on joint position and velocity, was used to represent human musculoskeletal dynamics. An active augmentation device was modeled as a torque actuator that could apply a single pulse of up to 100 Nm of extension torque. A passive design was modeled as rotational springs about each lower limb joint. Dynamic optimization searched for physiological and device actuation patterns to maximize jump distance. Results: Optimization of the nominal case yielded a 2.27 m jump that captured salient kinematic and kinetic features of human jumps. When the active device was added to the ankle, knee, or hip, jump distance increased to between 2.49 and 2.52 m. Active augmentation of all three joints increased the jump distance to 3.10 m. The passive design increased jump distance to 3.32 m by adding torques of 135, 365, and 297 Nm to the ankle, knee, and hip, respectively. Conclusion: Dynamic optimization can be used to simulate a standing long jump and investigate human-robot interaction. Significance: Simulation can aid in the design of performance-enhancing technologies.},

This framework is used to model uncertainties acting on the jumper during his jump, e.g., wind or mass, to enhance the performance, but also to increase the fairness and safety of the competition. For the uncertainty modeling the method of generalized polynomial chaos together with the discrete expansion by stochastic collocation is applied: This methodology offers a very flexible framework to model multiple uncertainties using a small number of required optimizations to calculate an uncertain trajectory. The results are then compared to the results of the Latin-Hypercube sampling method to show the correctness of the applied methods. Finally, the results are examined with respect to two major metrics: First, the influence of the uncertainties on the jumper, his positioning with respect to the air, and his maximal achievable flight distance are examined. Then, the results are used in a further step to quantify the safety of the jumper.},

  doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0197428},
  abstract = {Metabolic energy expenditure during human gait is poorly understood. Mechanical energy loss during heel strike contributes to this energy expenditure. Previous work has estimated the energy absorption during heel strike as 0.8 J using an effective foot mass model. The aim of our study is to investigate the possibility of determining the energy absorption by more directly estimating the work done by the ground reaction force, the force-integral method. Concurrently another aim is to compare this method of direct determination of work to the method of an effective foot mass model. Participants of our experimental study were asked to walk barefoot at preferred speed. Ground reaction force and lower leg kinematics were collected at high sampling frequency (3000 Hz; 1295 Hz), with tight synchronization. The work done by the ground reaction force is 3.8 J, estimated by integrating this force over the foot-ankle deformation. The effective mass model is improved by dropping the assumption that foot-ankle deformation is maximal at the instant of the impact force peak. On theoretical grounds it is clear that in the presence of substantial damping that peak force and peak deformation do not occur simultaneously. The energy absorption results, due the vertical force only, corresponding to the force-integral method is similar to the results of the improved application of the effective mass model (2.7 J; 2.5 J). However the total work done by the ground reaction force calculated by the force-integral method is significantly higher than that of the vertical component alone. We conclude that direct estimation of the work done by the ground reaction force is possible and preferable over the use of the effective foot mass model. Assuming that energy absorbed is lost, the mechanical energy loss of heel strike is around 3.8 J for preferred walking speeds ($\approx$ 1.3 m/s), which contributes to about 15\textendash{}20\% of the overall metabolic cost of transport.},

Simultaneously one can also control the lateral position of the base: changing of the track line of a bike or the position of hand under a balanced stick. We show here with theory and experiment that if the balance problem is removed, by making the system neutrally stable for balance, one cannot simultaneously maintain balance and control the position of the base. We made a bricycle, essentially a bicycle with springy training wheels. The stiffness of the training wheel suspension can be varied from near infinite, making the bricycle into a tricycle, to zero, making it effectively a bicycle. The springy training wheels effectively reduce or even negate gravity, at least for balance purposes. One might expect a smooth transition from tricycle to bicycle as the stiffness is varied, in terms of handling, balance and feel. Not so. At an intermediate stiffness, when gravity is effectively zeroed, riders can balance easily but no longer turn. Small turns cause an intolerable leaning. Thus there is a qualitative difference between bicycles and tricycles, a difference that cannot be met halfway.},

It is argued that it is most important for the understanding of the students to perform the first step whereas the actual implementation in a programming language is of secondary importance for the learning of problem-solving techniques. We therefore suggest to chose a well-structured teaching language that provides a clear and intuitive syntax and allows students to quickly express their algorithms.

First, the software can calculate variables that are difficult to measure experimentally, such as the forces generated by muscles and the stretch and recoil of tendons during movement. Second, OpenSim can predict novel movements from models of motor control, such as kinematic adaptations of human gait during loaded or inclined walking. Changes in musculoskeletal dynamics following surgery or due to human\textendash{}device interaction can also be simulated; these simulations have played a vital role in several applications, including the design of implantable mechanical devices to improve human grasping in individuals with paralysis.

  abstract = {Objective To synthesise the current evidence regarding the risk factors, the injury prevention strategies and the profile of injured skiers and snowboarders in terrain parks (TPs) and half-pipes (HPs).
Design Systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines.
Data sources Literature searches from six electronic databases and manual searches were performed.
Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Inclusion criteria were: (1) publication based on original data; (2) injuries sustained in TPs or HPs; (3) recreational skiing or snowboarding injuries; (4) observational or experimental study design with a comparison group.
Results No study explored the risk factors in HPs or the prevention strategies in TPs or HPs. From the literature retrieved, there is strong evidence that skiing or snowboarding in a TP is a risk factor for head, neck, back and severe injuries. Two papers assessed the risk factors for injuries in TPs, mainly demonstrating that features promoting aerial manoeuvres or a large drop to the ground were associated with higher feature-specific injury rates. The profile of injured skiers and snowboarders in TPs described in the literature suggested some evidence of associations between factors including activity, sex, skill level, helmet use, age and TP injuries.
Summary/conclusions This systematic review demonstrates the need for studies identifying the risk factors for injuries to skiers and snowboarders and on interventions to reduce the risk of injury in TPs and HPs. Studies addressing the issue of TP design should be considered.

Inputs include net joint torques that are used to vary the relative body configurations of the jumper during flight. The model also relies on aerodynamic data from previous wind tunnel tests that incorporate the effects of varying body configuration and orientation on lift, drag, and pitching moment. A symbolic manipulation program, ``Macsyma,'' is used to derive the equations of motion automatically. Experimental body segment orientation data during the flight phase are presented for three ski jumpers which show how jumpers of varying ability differ in flight and demonstrate the need for a more complex analytical model than that previously presented in the literature. Simulations are presented that qualitatively match the measured trajectory for a good jumper. The model can be used as a basis for the study of optimal jumper behavior in flight which maximizes jump distance.},

  abstract = {Objectives. We compared cycling injury risks of 14 route types and other route infrastructure features.
Methods. We recruited 690 city residents injured while cycling in Toronto or Vancouver, Canada. A case-crossover design compared route infrastructure at each injury site to that of a randomly selected control site from the same trip.
Results. Of 14 route types, cycle tracks had the lowest risk (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 0.11; 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 0.02, 0.54), about one ninth the risk of the reference: major streets with parked cars and no bike infrastructure. Risks on major streets were lower without parked cars (adjusted OR = 0.63; 95\% CI = 0.41, 0.96) and with bike lanes (adjusted OR = 0.54; 95\% CI = 0.29, 1.01). Local streets also had lower risks (adjusted OR = 0.51; 95\% CI = 0.31, 0.84). Other infrastructure characteristics were associated with increased risks: streetcar or train tracks (adjusted OR = 3.0; 95\% CI = 1.8, 5.1), downhill grades (adjusted OR = 2.3; 95\% CI = 1.7, 3.1), and construction (adjusted OR = 1.9; 95\% CI = 1.3, 2.9).
Conclusions. The lower risks on quiet streets and with bike-specific infrastructure along busy streets support the route-design approach used in many northern European countries. Transportation infrastructure with lower bicycling injury risks merits public health support to reduce injuries and promote cycling.

We demonstrate the approach on a variety of activities, such as walking, running, jumping, and kicking.

  abstract = {The quantification of mechanical power can provide valuable insight into athlete performance because it is the mechanical principle of the rate at which the athlete does work or transfers energy to complete a movement task. Estimates of power are usually limited by the capabilities of measurement systems, resulting in the use of simplified power models. This review provides a systematic overview of the studies on mechanical power in sports, discussing the application and estimation of mechanical power, the consequences of simplifications, and the terminology. The mechanical power balance consists of five parts, where joint power is equal to the sum of kinetic power, gravitational power, environmental power, and frictional power. Structuring literature based on these power components shows that simplifications in models are done on four levels, single vs multibody models, instantaneous power (IN) versus change in energy (EN), the dimensions of a model (1D, 2D, 3D), and neglecting parts of the mechanical power balance. Quantifying the consequences of simplification of power models has only been done for running, and shows differences ranging from 10\% up to 250\% compared to joint power models. Furthermore, inconsistency and imprecision were found in the determination of joint power, resulting from inverse dynamics methods, incorporation of translational joint powers, partitioning in negative and positive work, and power flow between segments. Most inconsistency in terminology was found in the definition and application of `external' and `internal' work and power. Sport research would benefit from structuring the research on mechanical power in sports and quantifying the result of simplifications in mechanical power estimations.},

  issn = {1476-4687},
  doi = {10.1038/nature14288},
  abstract = {With efficiencies derived from evolution, growth and learning, humans are very well-tuned for locomotion1. Metabolic energy used during walking can be partly replaced by power input from an exoskeleton2, but is it possible to reduce metabolic rate without providing an additional energy source? This would require an improvement in the efficiency of the human\textendash{}machine system as a whole, and would be remarkable given the apparent optimality of human gait. Here we show that the metabolic rate of human walking can be reduced by an unpowered ankle exoskeleton. We built a lightweight elastic device that acts in parallel with the user's calf muscles, off-loading muscle force and thereby reducing the metabolic energy consumed in contractions. The device uses a mechanical clutch to hold a spring as it is stretched and relaxed by ankle movements when the foot is on the ground, helping to fulfil one function of the calf muscles and Achilles tendon. Unlike muscles, however, the clutch sustains force passively. The exoskeleton consumes no chemical or electrical energy and delivers no net positive mechanical work, yet reduces the metabolic cost of walking by 7.2 $\pm$ 2.6\% for healthy human users under natural conditions, comparable to savings with powered devices. Improving upon walking economy in this way is analogous to altering the structure of the body such that it is more energy-effective at walking. While strong natural pressures have already shaped human locomotion, improvements in efficiency are still possible. Much remains to be learned about this seemingly simple behaviour.},

Artificial tendons are elastic elements that are able to store and redistribute energy over the human leg joints. The elastic characteristics of the tendons have been optimized to minimize the mechanical work of the human leg joints. In simulation the maximal reduction was 40 percent. The performance of the exoskeleton was evaluated in an experiment in which nine subjects participated. Energy expenditure and muscle activation were measured during three conditions: Normal walking, walking with the exoskeleton without artificial tendons, and walking with the exoskeleton with the artificial tendons. Normal walking was the most energy efficient. While walking with the exoskeleton, the artificial tendons only resulted in a negligibly small decrease in energy expenditure.},

  abstract = {Whether humans minimize metabolic energy in gait is unknown. Gradient-based optimization could be used to predict gait without using walking data but requires a twice differentiable metabolic energy model. Therefore, the metabolic energy model of Umberger et al. (2003) was adapted to be twice differentiable. Predictive simulations of a reaching task and gait were solved using this continuous model and by minimizing effort. The reaching task simulation showed that energy minimization predicts unrealistic movements when compared to effort minimization. The predictive gait simulations showed that objectives other than metabolic energy are also important in gait.},

  abstract = {Despite having a fully functional knee and hip in both legs, asymmetries in joint moments of the knee and hip are often seen in gait of persons with a unilateral transtibial amputation (TTA), possibly resulting in excessive joint loading. We hypothesize that persons with a TTA can walk with more symmetric joint moments at the cost of increased effort or abnormal kinematics. The hypothesis was tested using predictive simulations of gait. Open loop controls of one gait cycle were found by solving an optimization problem that minimizes a combination of walking effort and tracking error in joint angles, ground reaction force and gait cycle duration. A second objective was added to penalize joint moment asymmetry, creating a multi-objective optimization problem. A Pareto front was constructed by changing the weights of the objectives and three solutions were analyzed to study the effect of increasing joint moment symmetry. When the optimization placed more weight on moment symmetry, walking effort increased and kinematics became less normal, confirming the hypothesis. TTA gait improved with a moderate increase in joint moment symmetry. At a small cost of effort and abnormal kinematics, the peak hip extension moment in the intact leg was decreased significantly, and so was the joint contact force in the knee and hip. Additional symmetry required a significant increase in walking effort and the joint contact forces in both hips became significantly higher than in able-bodied gait.},

  abstract = {The human ankle varies impedance and delivers net positive work during the stance period of walking. In contrast, commercially available ankle-foot prostheses are passive during stance, causing many clinical problems for transtibial amputees, including non-symmetric gait patterns, higher gait metabolism, and poorer shock absorption. In this investigation, we develop and evaluate a myoelectric-driven, finite state controller for a powered ankle-foot prosthesis that modulates both impedance and power output during stance. The system employs both sensory inputs measured local to the external prosthesis, and myoelectric inputs measured from residual limb muscles. Using local prosthetic sensing, we first develop two finite state controllers to produce biomimetic movement patterns for level-ground and stair-descent gaits. We then employ myoelectric signals as control commands to manage the transition between these finite state controllers. To transition from level-ground to stairs, the amputee flexes the gastrocnemius muscle, triggering the prosthetic ankle to plantar flex at terminal swing, and initiating the stair-descent state machine algorithm. To transition back to level-ground walking, the amputee flexes the tibialis anterior muscle, triggering the ankle to remain dorsiflexed at terminal swing, and initiating the level-ground state machine algorithm. As a preliminary evaluation of clinical efficacy, we test the device on a transtibial amputee with both the proposed controller and a conventional passive-elastic control. We find that the amputee can robustly transition between the finite state controllers through direct muscle activation, allowing rapid transitioning from level-ground to stair walking patterns. Additionally, we find that the proposed finite state controllers result in a more biomimetic ankle response, producing net propulsive work during level-ground walking and greater shock absorption during stair descent. The results of this study highlight the potential of prosthetic leg controllers that exploit neural signals to trigger terrain-appropriate, local prosthetic leg behaviors.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the design and preliminary evaluation of an elastic lower-body exoskeleton (eExo). Human legs behave in a spring-like fashion while running. We selected a design that relied solely on material elasticity to store and release energy during the stance phase of running. The exoskeleton included a novel knee joint with a cam and a Bowden cable transferring energy to and from a waist-mounted extension spring. We used a friction-lock clutch controlled by hip angle via a pneumatic cylinder to release the cable during swing phase for free movement of the leg. The design also incorporated a composite leaf spring to store and release energy in the distal portion of the exoskeleton about the foot and ankle. Preliminary test data for our target subject showed that his typical leg deflection was 0.11 m with leg stiffness of 16 kN/m while running at 3.0 m/s. We used these values to set the desired stiffness (60$\pm$15\% of the normal leg stiffness, or 9.6$\pm$2.4 kN/m) and deflection (0.11 m) of the exoskeleton. We created simplified multi-body and full finite element quasi-static models to achieve the desired system stiffness and validate our results, respectively. The final design model had an overall stiffness of 7.3 kN/m, which was within the desired range. We fabricated a single-leg prototype of the exo\textendash{}skeleton that weighed 7.1 kg. We tested the exoskeleton stiffness quasi-statically and found a stiffness of 3.6 kN/m. While running, the exoskeleton provided $\sim$30\% of the total leg stiffness for two subjects. Although the stiffness was lower than desired, the fabricated prototype demonstrated the ability of a quasi-passive exoskeleton to provide a significant portion of an individual's leg stiffness while running.},

  abstract = {Although there have been many lower limb robotic exoskeletons that have been tested for human walking, few devices have been tested for assisting running. It is possible that a pseudo-passive elastic exoskeleton could benefit human running without the addition of electrical motors due to the spring-like behavior of the human leg. We developed an elastic lower limb exoskeleton that added stiffness in parallel with the entire lower limb. Six healthy, young subjects ran on a treadmill at 2.3 m/s with and without the exoskeleton. Although the exoskeleton was designed to provide \textasciitilde{}50\% of normal leg stiffness during running, it only provided 24\% of leg stiffness during testing. The difference in added leg stiffness was primarily due to soft tissue compression and harness compliance decreasing exoskeleton displacement during stance. As a result, the exoskeleton only supported about 7\% of the peak vertical ground reaction force. There was a significant increase in metabolic cost when running with the exoskeleton compared with running without the exoskeleton (ANOVA, P $<$ .01). We conclude that 2 major roadblocks to designing successful lower limb robotic exoskeletons for human running are human-machine interface compliance and the extra lower limb inertia from the exoskeleton.},

Although effective at their intended gait speed and terrain, these controllers do not allow for adaptation to environmental disturbances such as speed transients and terrain variation. Here we present an adaptive muscle-reflex controller, based on simulation studies, that utilizes an ankle plantar flexor comprising a Hill-type muscle with a positive force feedback reflex. The model's parameters were fitted to match the human ankle's torque-angle profile as obtained from level-ground walking measurements of a weight and height-matched intact subject walking at 1 m/s. Using this single parameter set, clinical trials were conducted with a transtibial amputee walking on level ground, ramp ascent, and ramp descent conditions. During these trials, an adaptation of prosthetic ankle work was observed in response to ground slope variation, in a manner comparable to intact subjects, without the difficulties of explicit terrain sensing. Specifically, the energy provided by the prosthesis was directly correlated to the ground slope angle. This study highlights the importance of neuromuscular controllers for enhancing the adaptiveness of powered prosthetic devices across varied terrain surfaces.},

  abstract = {At moderate to fast walking speeds, the human ankle provides net positive work at high-mechanical-power output to propel the body upward and forward during the stance period. On the contrary, conventional ankle-foot prostheses exhibit a passive-elastic response during stance, and consequently, cannot provide net work. Clinical studies indicate that transtibial amputees using conventional prostheses have higher gait metabolic rates than normal. Researchers believe that the main cause for these higher rates is due to the inability of conventional prostheses to provide sufficient positive power at terminal stance in the trailing leg to limit heel strike losses of the adjacent leading leg. In this investigation, we evaluate the hypothesis that a powered ankle-foot prosthesis, capable of providing human-like ankle work and power during stance, can decrease the metabolic cost of transport (COT) compared to a conventional passive-elastic prosthesis. To test the hypothesis, a powered prosthesis is built that comprises a unidirectional spring, configured in parallel with a force-controllable actuator with series elasticity. The prosthesis is shown to deliver the high mechanical power and net positive work observed in normal human walking. The rate of oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production is measured as a determinant of metabolic rate on three unilateral transtibial amputees walking at self-selected speeds. We find that the powered prosthesis decreases the amputee's metabolic COT on average by 14\% compared to the conventional passive-elastic prostheses evaluated (Flex-Foot Ceterus\textsuperscript{reg} and Freedom Innovations Sierra), even though the powered system is over twofold heavier than the conventional devices. These results highlight the clinical importance of prosthetic interventions that closely mimic the mass distribution, kinetics, and kinematics of the missing limb.},

  abstract = {Simulations are attractive environments for training agents as they provide an abundant source of data and alleviate certain safety concerns during the training process. But the behaviours developed by agents in simulation are often specific to the characteristics of the simulator. Due to modeling error, strategies that are successful in simulation may not transfer to their real world counterparts. In this paper, we demonstrate a simple method to bridge this "reality gap". By randomizing the dynamics of the simulator during training, we are able to develop policies that are capable of adapting to very different dynamics, including ones that differ significantly from the dynamics on which the policies were trained. This adaptivity enables the policies to generalize to the dynamics of the real world without any training on the physical system. Our approach is demonstrated on an object pushing task using a robotic arm. Despite being trained exclusively in simulation, our policies are able to maintain a similar level of performance when deployed on a real robot, reliably moving an object to a desired location from random initial configurations. We explore the impact of various design decisions and show that the resulting policies are robust to significant calibration error.},

In this paper, we present an approach to the synthesis and stabilization of complex trajectories for both fully-actuated and underactuated robots subject to contact constraints. We introduce a trajectory optimization algorithm (DIRCON) that extends the direct collocation method, naturally incorporating manifold constraints to produce a nominal trajectory with third-order integration accuracy\textemdash{}a critical feature for achieving reliable tracking control. We adapt the classical time-varying linear quadratic regulator to produce a local cost-to-go in the manifold tangent plane. Finally, we descend the cost-to-go using a quadratic program that incorporates unilateral friction and torque constraints.

  shorttitle = {{{SFV}}},
  abstract = {Data-driven character animation based on motion capture can produce highly naturalistic behaviors and, when combined with physics simulation, can provide for natural procedural responses to physical perturbations, environmental changes, and morphological discrepancies. Motion capture remains the most popular source of motion data, but collecting mocap data typically requires heavily instrumented environments and actors. In this paper, we propose a method that enables physically simulated characters to learn skills from videos (SFV). Our approach, based on deep pose estimation and deep reinforcement learning, allows data-driven animation to leverage the abundance of publicly available video clips from the web, such as those from YouTube. This has the potential to enable fast and easy design of character controllers simply by querying for video recordings of the desired behavior. The resulting controllers are robust to perturbations, can be adapted to new settings, can perform basic object interactions, and can be retargeted to new morphologies via reinforcement learning. We further demonstrate that our method can predict potential human motions from still images, by forward simulation of learned controllers initialized from the observed pose. Our framework is able to learn a broad range of dynamic skills, including locomotion, acrobatics, and martial arts.},

  abstract = {[Tire models used in vehicle dynamics simulation and tirerelated research rely basically on curve fitted experimental data and empirical adjustments of theoretical models. The complexity of tire mechanics has limited the development of a complete and reasonable analytical force theory. This paper validates an analytical tire model recently developed by the author. This theoretical model uses physical parameters: lateral and longitudinal stiffnesses, aligning moment pneumatic trail, overturning moment arm, lateral force relaxation length, and friction properties. These are standard mechanical properties that characterize the force generating capacity of tires. The validation procedure compares the theoretical ground forces and moments with experimental data. Tire data measured on aflat track tire testing machine are used in this validation. It covers the full range of longitudinal, lateral, and combined slips. This model can be applied in vehicle dynamics simulations up to extreme handling maneuvers and can be used to assess the effect of a specific tire's physical property on the performance of vehicle motion and stability. This validated analytical tire model is an important advancement in the field of tire force and moment predictions and puts more emphasis on the mechanics of contact rather than curvefitting practices.]},

By selecting proper values, the characteristics for either side force, aligning torque or fore and aft force can be obtained. The new version of the model contains physically based formulations to avoid the introduction of correction factors. Double-sided, possibly non-symmetric pure slip curves are employed as the basis for combined slip calculations.

  abstract = {[The behaviour of the tyre plays an important role in controlling the horizontal motion of the vehicle. In vehicle dynamics studies, a good representation of tyre behaviour is therefore a necessity. A series of tyre measurements have been carried out on the road in stationary conditions. The data obtained have been represented by mathematical expressions on the basis of a formula. The coefficients in the formula represent some of the typifying quantities of the tyre and the formula is capable of describing all characteristics of side force, brake force and self aligning torque with great accuracy. The behaviour of the tyre during combined cornering and braking has successfully been described by a model which makes use of the obtained mathematical expressions and some tyre-modelling theory. The side force characteristic governs the behaviour in lateral direction and the brake force characteristic in longitudinal direction. Thus, the non-isotropic properties of the tyre have been taken into account. Influences of ply steer, conicity, rolling resistance and camber are included as well. In this way a new and compact empirical model is obtained, enabling sensitivity studies to be performed. Vehicle dynamics studies have been carried out with the aid of simulations including the new model.

Zeros are a fundamental aspect of systems and control theory; however, the causes and effects of zeros are more subtle than those of poles. In particular, positive zeros can cause initial undershoot (initial error growth), zero crossings, and overshoot in the step response of a system, whereas nonminimum-phase zeros limit bandwidth. Both of these aspects have real-world implications in many applications. Nonminimum-phase zeros exacerbate the tradeoff between the robustness and achievable performance of a feedback control system. From a control-theoretic point of view, a nonminimum-phase zero in the loop transfer function L is arguably the worst feature a system can possess. Every feedback synthesis methodology must accept limitations due to the presence of open-right-half-plane zeros, and the mark of a good analysis tool is the ability to capture the performance limitations arising from nonminimum-phase zeros.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes an adaptive trajectory tracking control for an autonomous planar two-wheeled vehicle subject to nonholonomic constraints. Furthermore, the vehicle model considers a so-called positive trail that provides self-alignment of the steering in many vehicle types, including bicycles. The dynamics of the system is described in a port-Hamiltonian form that is suitable for systematic synthesis of passivity-based controllers. This also enables an explicit description of the system dynamics including the nonholonomic constraints by an ODE. By a generalized canonical transformation, an error system is determined preserving the port-Hamiltonian structure. This reduces the tracking problem to a stabilization problem that is solved by a further transformation. The controller is designed for a structure preserving simplified model and applied to the original model handling the omitted effects due to the simplification as disturbance. Finally, an adaptive controller is applied that, in the port-Hamiltonian framework, guarantees the asymptotic tracking of a given trajectory despite large parameter uncertainties.},

Here, we use a simple biped model capable of walking stably in three dimensions to examine these questions. We simulate multiple such stable bipeds walking simultaneously on a bridge, showing that they naturally synchronize under certain conditions, but that synchronization is not required to shake the bridge. Under such shaking conditions, the simulated walkers increase their step widths and expend more metabolic energy than when the bridge does not shake. We also find that such bipeds can walk stably on externally shaken treadmills, synchronizing with the treadmill motion for a range of oscillation amplitudes and frequencies. Our simulations illustrate how interactions between (idealized) bipeds through the walking surface can produce emergent collective behaviour that may not be exhibited by just a single biped.},

  abstract = {Advances in experimental techniques and computational power allowing researchers to gather anatomical and electrophysiological data at unprecedented levels of detail have fostered the development of increasingly complex models in computational neuroscience. Large-scale, biophysically detailed cell models pose a particular set of computational challenges, and this has led to the development of a number of domain-specific simulators. At the other level of detail, the ever growing variety of point neuron models increases the implementation barrier even for those based on the relatively simple integrate-and-fire neuron model. Independently of the model complexity, all modeling methods crucially depend on an efficient and accurate transformation of mathematical model descriptions into efficiently executable code. Neuroscientists usually publish model descriptions in terms of the mathematical equations underlying them. However, actually simulating them requires they be translated into code. This can cause problems because errors may be introduced if this process is carried out by hand, and code written by neuroscientists may not be very computationally efficient. Furthermore, the translated code might be generated for different hardware platforms, operating system variants or even written in different languages and thus cannot easily be combined or even compared. Two main approaches to addressing this issues have been followed. The first is to limit users to a fixed set of optimized models, which limits flexibility. The second is to allow model definitions in a high level interpreted language, although this may limit performance. Recently, a third approach has become increasingly popular: using code generation to automatically translate high level descriptions into efficient low level code to combine the best of previous approaches. This approach also greatly enriches efforts to standardize simulator-independent model description languages. In the past few years, a number of code generation pipelines have been developed in the computational neuroscience community, which differ considerably in aim, scope and functionality. This article provides an overview of existing pipelines currently used within the community and contrasts their capabilities and the technologies and concepts behind them.},

  abstract = {In recent years, researchers from both academia and industry have worked on connected and automated vehicles and they have made great progress toward bringing them into reality. Compared to automated cars, bicycles are more affordable to daily commuters, as well as more environmentally friendly. When comparing the risk posed by autonomous vehicles to pedestrians and motorists, automated bicycles are much safer than autonomous cars, which also allows potential applications in smart cities, rehabilitation, and exercise. The biggest challenge in automating bicycles is the inherent problem of staying balanced. This paper presents a modified electric bicycle to allow real-time monitoring of the roll angles and motor-assisted steering. Stable and robust steering controllers for bicycle are designed and implemented to achieve self-balance at different forward speeds. Tests at different speeds have been conducted to verify the effectiveness of hardware development and controller design. The preliminary design using a control moment gyroscope (CMG) to achieve self-balancing at lower speeds are also presented in this work. This work can serve as a solid foundation for future study of human-robot interaction and autonomous driving.},

In instructional material this phase is often considered a free fall, but when the mass of the bungee rope is taken into account, the bungee jumper reaches acceleration greater than g. This result is contrary to the usual experience with free falling objects and therefore hard to believe for many a person, even an experienced physicist. It is often a starting point for heated discussions about the quality of the experiments and the physics knowledge of the experimentalist, or it may even prompt complaints about the quality of current physics education. But experiments do reveal the truth and students can do them supported by information and communication technology (ICT) tools.

  abstract = {Background Modeling abilities play an important role in engineering. The creation and use of representations is a central aspect of modeling, and students who are learning to model often use a variety of representations to express, test, revise, and communicate their own thinking. Consequently, model development often depends on representational fluency and the ability to translate between and within different representational forms.
Purpose This study investigates the role that representations and representational fluency play in conceptual understanding during a complex modeling task related to heat transfer. Design/Method This study involved 16 teams of 3 or 4 college students in a first-semester heat transfer course participating in a complex modeling task. The task of the student teams was to develop a model to predict the interface temperature and the sensation felt by human skin when touching a utensil made of a given material at a given temperature. Data sources included audio recordings of student teams, as well as student-generated artifacts.
Results The results show teams thinking about their model through multiple representations and through translations within and among representations. Students' early ways of thinking used a variety of interacting representations but were often unstable and involved incomplete notions of the system to be modeled. Model development involved increasing representational fluency as well as parallel and interacting progress along a variety of dimensions.
Conclusions This study furthers the understanding of representational fluency in undergraduate engineering students in a heat transfer setting and how representational fluency contributes to conceptual and application understanding.},

In past work, we have presented a theoretical and computational framework for assessing the lateral task-independent handling qualities of simplified single track vehicle designs [1, 4]. In subsequent work, we showed that minimizing our handling quality metric (HQM) can produce theoretically optimal handling designs when only four geometric parameters are explored as the optimization variables [3]. The present work's goal is to expand this optimization problem to 24 geometry, mass, and inertial parameters as the optimization variables so that a broader search space of optimal bicycle designs is considered. This task is complicated by the fact that we desire to limit the search space to physically realizable designs. Doing so introduces 35 linear and nonlinear constraint equations on the optimization variables. We formulate a constrained optimization problem and use nonlinear programming to discover optimal, yet realizable, bicycle designs.},

Administrators need to bear this in mind in their assessment of student ratings so that they do not encourage instructors to teach in fear of their evaluations.},

  abstract = {Students completed a questionnaire on the meanings of several terms commonly used in narrative course evaluation forms, and instructors completed a similar form asking them what they believed students meant by these same words. Both groups produced complex and multifaceted definitions for the terms ``not fair,'' ``professional,'' ``not organized,'' ``challenging,'' and ``not respectful.'' Instructors were frequently incorrect in inferring common student definitions. If instructors misjudge students' meanings, how useful are evaluation forms for evaluative or developmental purposes? Faculty peer review of class meetings and course materials can help provide the necessary filter for interpreting evaluation comments.},
