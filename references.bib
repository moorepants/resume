The full kinematics of bicycles and riders were measured with an active motion capture system. Motion across speeds are compared graphically with box and whiskers plots. Trends and ranges in amplitude are shown to characterize the system motion. This data will be used to develop a realistic biomechanical model and control model for the rider and for future experimental design.",

    abstract = "A model describing rider control while steering and stabilizing a bicycle has been developed. Experimental data were obtained from riding a bicycle on a narrow treadmill while perturbing balance with impulsive forces at the seat post. The experiments were conducted at 2–7 m/s covering both the stable and the unstable forward speed range. Bicycle and rider mechanics have been modeled using the Whipple bicycle model extended with the rider inertia. A rider control model applying steering torque at the handle bars has been developed exploring potential feedback of visual, vestibular and arm proprioceptive cues. The identified rider control parameters, after model reduction, stabilize the system and mimic realistic rider control behavior. The feedback gains of this control model were used to identify the specific optimal control linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) cost function which the rider was using to control the bicycle. The identified cost functions indicate that at low speed the rider minimizes his control effort and at high speed he minimizes the heading error.",

The observations also revealed that other motions such as lateral movement of the knees were used in low speed stabilization. In order to validate the hypothesis that there is little upper body motion during casual cycling, an in-depth motion capture analysis was performed on the bicycle and rider system. We used motion capture technology to record the motion of three similar young adult male riders riding two different city bicycles on a treadmill. Each rider rode each bicycle while performing stability trials at speeds ranging from 2 km/h to 30 km/h: stabilizing while pedaling normally, stabilizing without pedaling, line tracking while pedaling, and stabilizing with no-hands. These tasks were chosen with the intent of examining differences in the kinematics at various speeds, the effects of pedaling on the system, upper body control motions and the differences in tracking and stabilization. Principal component analysis was used to transform the data into a manageable set organized by the variance associated with the principal components. In this paper, these principal components were used to characterize various distinct kinematic motions that occur during stabilization with and without pedaling. These motions were grouped on the basis of correlation and conclusions were drawn about which motions are candidates for stabilization-related control actions.",

Previous models determined the sensitivity of stability to changes in parameters, but have often used idealized parameters occurring in the equations of motion that were not possible to realistically change independently. A mathematical model of a bicycle is developed and verified. The model is used together with a physical parameter generation algorithm to evaluate the dependence of four important actual design parameters on the self-stability of a bicycle."
